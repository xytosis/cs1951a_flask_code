"People keep throwing around the word ""bitch"". I don't think you understand what that word means or what was going on in this video.  She is an ACTRESS and he is an ACTOR. These ""reality TV"" shows are mostly scripted. She was playing a part and so was he. Her ""bitchy"" behavior is just a role that she was asked to play.  The problem, however, is that the contract they BOTH signed stated there would be no contact. Verbal abuse, yes, that's the point of the show (a stupid premise, but whatever). Physical abuse, however, was not allowed.  So when she slapped him, she was improvising her role, but in a way that violated her contract.  That's why he says ""how can she slap?"" He's demanding an explanation from the producers of the show: How can she do this? I didn't sign up for this!  In other words, she is NOT a bitch. ""Bitch"" would imply she's doing this out of malice, but she's not. She's ACTING. So in this case, she is just someone who screwed up doing her job. She's a bad actress, not a bitch. He's actually not justified in hitting her in this case, because then he also violates his contract. He should have just thrown his hands up and said, ""Fuck this, I didn't sign up for this, I'm out."" And then sued the show for breach of contract.  ",-9

"I love your little argument about Therrien knowing better than us.  Tell me what are Galchenyuk's stats after being moved to LW compared to when he was at Centre, hmm? The promising prospect we drafted to be a *center* is supposed to continue his development at *LW* after four years? Okay.  And he might be trying to win games, but oh my god is he failing completely at it. You seriously think he'll be able to find another NHL job after this failure of a season? He had a better season with Pittsburgh when he was fired and we only picked him up cause he speaks French.  MT's success = Price.  I don't think MT or the players are intentionally tanking, of course not. I think that MT's knowledge on how to be an NHL coach is making the players so bad that it's gotten to the point where we are so bad it resembles a tank. Only good thing about this season is to find humour in the tank joke.  And MB is deliberately tanking. The coach or players won't tank, but the GM can. And he is. No way he makes no moves and doesn't fire the coach, any normal coach would've done something by now. So obvious he is steering this team towards a top 3 pick. His conference pretty much confirmed it.  ",-6

People want edgy programming from WWE but yet are going crazy over this kind of stuff? I'm kinda lost in all honesty.  Not here to argue, just an opinion of a fan who tunes in to raw now and again. I used to go on various forums a few years back and see people moaning about cena's childish stuff, not been following WWE religiously over the last couple of years.

"I am not opposed to background checks, but what I would really like to see is the gun manufacturers get caught up to the 21st century.   All guns need to have a finger print reader on the trigger so that it can only be operated by the gun owner. Encoding would take place the point of sale once person has passed background checks.  This would serve two purposes:   1. Prevent a person in using a stolen gun that are used in mass shootings (most guns used in mass shootings/killings are stolen from the rightful owner) 2. This protects gun owners from having their guns used against them or to be accidentally discharged by a little kid in the house.   Finger print reader is very cheap and small now days that this is certainly in the realm of feasibility. I don't know of any reasonable gun owner who would oppose this idea - it makes logical sense from all angles. ",-7

"&gt;And then comes the main conclusion, in the second-to-last paragraph  But maybe we should see what the **last** paragraph has to say before rushing to any judgments:  &gt;Nevertheless, it’s important to note that you should **hardly abandon contributing to your retirement funds.**  You don't like the author's points about obstacles to retirement, which is fine. But don't just chalk the whole thing up to a lack of personal accountability. I don't know your financial situation, but you're probably doing well if you're posting here. Please just keep in mind that the vast majority of the nation - and the world - isn't anywhere near as privileged. So the ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" message is just as useless to them as, I presume, entitlement programs are to you.

"All right. Time to bring the throwdown.  **Chess** is more luck based than people think.  Most people will argue that an entirely deterministic game with no RNG has no basis in luck.  But consider that the world chess championship finals is often conducted as a *best of 12* or more. By contrast street fighter, StarCraft, dota and hearthstone finals tend to be best of 5 or 7. And it stands to reason that the only reason lots of matches should be scheduled is to dull the effect of non-skill based factors (i.e. RNG).. So what gives?  The answer I'd give is that chess players have a limited amount of foresight into the chaos of the future. For argument, say they can think 11 turns forward with clarity, and 8 more turns in a fuzzy way. Deterministic though it may be, if the turn 20 turns from now is invisible to both players, it might as well be random, because the effect this turn has on it is not in either player's head, and thus is not interacting with either player's skill.  One more analogy,  Consider the game ""guess the digit of pi"". The referee gives a very large n, and two players quote the nth digit of pi. If only one player gets it right they win. Otherwise you play again with a new n. This game is entirely deterministic, and for low values of n, very skill based. But how about for high values of n?  Edit: Bring on the downvotes, but know that Luck and Skill are a false dichotomy. I'm not saying Chess takes less skill because it takes more luck than you think. More luck in a game doesn't mean less skill. Angry yet? Good. Consider my example: the classic example of ""Rando Chess"" where you play a chess match and then roll a dice, reversing the winner on a 1 roll. Rando Chess definitely takes more luck than Chess, obviously. But it's hard to argue that it takes less skill. You still have the same strategy books, same rankings, and given enough games played to quash the randomness, the same world champion.  This isn't me insulting Chess. This is me insulting the ridiculous notion that determinism makes a game entirely skill based.",-10

"Your reasoning is flawed. If X is often wrong, and X said something, X is not necessarily wrong. It's nonsense and for something like media coverage, in which some aspects of political discourse are disallowed by the traditional media by their ""controversial"" nature.  I would argue the traditional media is a ""waste of time"" because it frames our political discussion how they prefer. In fact, it costs them money to leave this frame. http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/11/01/abc-rei-respond-to-air-america-blacklist-memo/137154  Also, CNN is a middle of the road network within our incredibly flawed, access journalism devoted, economically-conservative-leaning mainstream media.

"If you understand statistics then you know they are bullshit. Just the flip of a coin shows this. You have a 50% chance of landing on heads or tails (actually it's more 51-49 because one side always starts facing up, but it's close enough) so statistics tells you that if you flip that coin 100 times you'll get 50 heads and 50 tails, but then when you do flip that coin 100 times you may end up getting 60 heads, or 99 tails. Lets look at other statistics. A new study shows that 65% of Americans are obese. Did all 300 million Americans get measured and weighed for this study? No. So is it accurate? Maybe, but not based on the means used to get those figures. Those figures cannot be proven. They are bullshit. Statistics are mostly used to convince ignorant politicians to vote in favor of things that aren't necessary. They are a tactic of manipulation. There are rarely any cases of verifiable statistics. Only things fully kept in public records are verifiable, like how many times a police officer shoots someone, or how many gallons of water go through a sewer each day.",-19

"Wow, did not expect reddit to side so much with the RA here. Fuck that, I'm on this student's side. At my former law school we had this same problem in which a super convenient door exit was located right next to the main stairs. EVERYONE used that exit until they decided to put up big signs saying it was an ""Emergency Exit."" Which they would continually remind everyone not to use.  Now, this may seem like a minor annoyance but when you are spending A QUARTER OF A GODDAMN MILLION DOLLARS to get an education its the continual little things that slowly drive you insane. It's not just the sign on the door blocking an especially convenient exit, it's also how the school will try to nickel and dime you for every extra thing.   -You have to pay for your books.  -You have to pay for that special clicker used in only one class.   -You have to buy the special extra supplement book that wasn't in the syllabus but the professor decided to add on.  -You have to pay to print out anything in the library.  -You have to pay if you want to copy anything in the library.  -You have to pay for YOUR OWN TRANSCRIPT.  -You can't just immediately get your transcript, no they must mail it to you even though you live two blocks from the school and it will take a week to come in the mail.  -You have to provide a dozen forms of identifications, fill out three forms, and sign a hundred times before the school will sign one document you need.  -You can't have alcohol served at official school club activities.  -You can't come late to this lecture or you'll be shown out, publicly ridiculed by the Professor, or simply denied being able to take the final.  One of these by themselves isn't so bad but when you combine them altogether on top of your continued miserable college/post-grad existence of trying to maintain a decent GPA while at the same time looking for future employment (which the school is completely unwilling to help you find) it tends to grind heavily on you.  So when you finish another miserable lecture and are just looking to head back to your dorm for a momentary respite from this soul crushing existence and find that the simple, easy, and logical exit is now being blocked and on top of that the school is making fun of you, YOU for daring to question their judgment after sapping you for every dime...

"I agree it has become semantics, because the common use of the terms moral, immoral, amoral have adopted a separate secular meaning from the religious meaning. But the concept of sex outside of marriage and immorality brought up in the initial post focus it to the non-secular concept, which in that context is held to be immoral, unless there is a religion of which I'm not yet aware that sits on the sidelines on that topic.  But predating organized religion, instinct developed via Darwanism is not equivalent to moral behavior, whether in the lower or upper animal kingdom.  I realize it's polishing a turd at this point, but the first use of the word ""morals"" is derived from an exposition on the morals described in the Book of Job, a specifically religious codification of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, a distinctly religious application of the word.    I realize it can be daunting to some atheists and agnostics--not referring to you--to come to terms with having no moral basis for action, only reason. I struggled with that one for awhile myself. But when one decides to go it alone in the universe without a deity having control, one has to grab the reins of responsibility for their own behavior and not shift that responsibility from God to society.",-9

Wait until the free 'Obamaphones' spread to every person on the planet, and paying with things using your phone becomes the only way to do commerce.

Most of the phones can have their microphones and cameras turned on even if you powered it off, and with very little effort with today's technology your voice can be replicated, and video allows analysis of body movement, which is more a part of human communication than spoken language anyways.",-9

They ride Microsoft/xbox's dick about everything. Part of the whole fan boy thing too many take part in, forgetting Microsoft is a huge fucking company and make mistakes on a regular basis. Tho i agree they do the things they do mostly to create a positive view amongst users. Such as their security measures and the like. However essentially calling you a liar or saying it's completely your fault isn't helping and is only trying to make sure Microsoft doesn't get the blame. A company that big is bound to have mishaps sometimes. That wouldn't even be the companies fault. Nor would how they have to react to it. It kinda screws you but overall it seems to be a system that works. As far as I know anyway.

"To be clear: it's not solely* a dick move. From what I've seen, it serves two main purposes:  * It weeds out insecure applicants. I want applicants who believe they're better than their resumes make them look. I want applicants who are confident in their abilities, who will look at the '5 years' and say, 'I've got the equivalent of 5 years because that's how fucking awesome I am'.  * It gives us a position of strength when negotiating salary. You've proven to us that even though the description said 5 years, you're ready for the job fresh out of college -- buuuuut, the original job description did say 5 years, so we've got to start you at the low end of that salary range. You understand, of course -- we were expecting to be paying someone more experienced. By the time you have the 5 years experience we asked for, though, you'll be making way more than the salary range we promised!  Both these only work in an employers' market. If you're living in San Francisco and you're a competent web developer, you can throw this out the window because we're *dying* to hire you. We'll promise more benefits and salary and require less experience because we know you're the supply and we're the demand. You're scarce; we're plentiful. But if you're in a field where there are more applicants than jobs, then you're the demand and we're the supply -- and we can jack up the requirements to make sure we're getting the best. Nowadays, most markets are still employers' markets, at least outside the tech industry.  So, even if you don't meet the letter of the job description, apply anyway, and be prepared to go in with an explanation for why you're just as qualified as the person they said they wanted. (Note: this doesn't apply to many jobs in the public sector, where bureaucracy means hiring managers are more likely to stick to the letter of the description rather than risk being held accountable for hiring someone under-qualified. But in the private sector, this applies.)  \* - I'm not going to argue it's not a dick move at all, just that something good *does* come of it... well, from our end. In the places where I've worked in hiring, we've never failed to fill an opening except in technical roles. So, I guess if you're having trouble finding work, learn to program?",-8

"Er, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Just because it happens rarely doesn't mean it isn't legal. There is absolutely no law restricting people from having an abortion at any time, for any reason. People generally don't just decide to keep a baby until 30 weeks and then abort it, but that doesn't mean it isn't legal.  According to the National Post. ""While in Canada we do not have a law, we do have very strict professional guidelines. No physician in Canada can terminate a pregnancy over 24 weeks without serious indications that the life of the mother is at risk or that the fetus has very serious malformations.""  Again, professional guidelines, not law. Everything I said was correct.  Also, I'd like to add that late-term abortions that are performed because a fetus is ""gravely impaired"" would still be at best a very controversial procedure to undertake.",-8

It does not matter what the people in the company want if they can't make it make money. What you are thinking about is a normal - reasonable - business, one that can reflect the values of the individuals inside it. A corporation can do things in a way that reflects values, but only to the point that it remains profitable. Unfortunately, continual increases in profit margins requires the removal of a number of moral barriers. The people inside the corporation can only press towards the side of morality and attempt to sway the means of profit towards something they can sleep at night doing, but that's about it.",-10

""" Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the AfricanAmerican community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.

Does he spend time out without you on somewhat regular basis?  Before taking any steps collect all information possible. When you bring the subject up, be ready for anything: he may leave you to be with other woman and their baby, for invading his privacy (a child is not something that should be that ""privacy""), or you may see no future with a coward and a liar.

That combining them creates some sort of poison. This is how Islam leaders think. Segregation and separation. Only one way of being. It's anti-American.  I remember thinking how terrible of someone to think this way and to have a religion preach this.   I'm pretty sure at the time Spike Lee was trying to give another message that missed the point.

Of course, if it's near that number, it can still be ""profitable"" with merchandising or home video release-- take Watchmen, which wasn't profitable in theaters, but through several versions of home release and more importantly the merchandising it invigorated for comic sales, and toys/shirts/etc made it a profitable endeavor for DC/Warner Bros.  But, of course, no one wants to admit their movie was a failure, so actual monetary returns and even the actual budget are never accurate, they're more ballpark figures, if that. It's also hard to necessarily say what should be counted as the actual budget-- should they include the price they paid James Cameron for his Spider-Man script in the development cost of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man?

All of those are about abuse and human trafficking...   **Edit:** Below is the synopsis, where is the smuggling or counterfeit vodka scheme im missing? I can't watch this at work so I am genuinely curious why I'm being so heavily downvoted for wanting some proof of this, SVU generally doesn't deal with fraud and smuggling unless it's smuggling people.   &gt;A victim is found bound and gagged in the closet of a conference room in an office suite. While a rape kit is being done on her, the FBI arrest her for securities fraud and take her away. Amanda Curry is the victim in one crime and the criminal in another. Olivia and Elliott go to federal lock up to speak to her about the rape attack, but they cannot ask her anything about the securities fraud charge. Amanda cannot identify her attacker but she thinks it could be the men she was working with to launder money. Evidence points to someone who either worked in the office building or pretended to work there, they left a blue jumpsuit behind.

Who is to be believed?*  Interviewee then replies: *It’s in contrast to what Planned Parenthood and its allies argue, but it’s actually consistent with Planned Parenthood’s own report. The Fusion GPS report commissioned by Planned Parenthood confirms that the audio is not tampered with and that its “analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.” Coalfire confirms that finding, looking even at the raw source footage. But where the Fusion GPS report only had access to the full videos on YouTube and raised suspicion about the “edits” in those videos, Coalfire looked at the full raw footage and confirmed David Daleiden’s explanation that the “edits” to the full videos that CMP has posted on YouTube are “non-pertinent.”*",-20

"I was just saying to consider it, as many women already wrote about having completely different feelings during and after pregnancy. I didn't say you have it also. But if you don't it's fine. And I never said it was not a big mistake to put your child on a risk. It was a huge mistake and yes, no one should risk their child's life. I totally agree in that point. As I said he really messed up on you. But as I said, I could imagine, that he was also out of his mind. Of course he should have questioned the accusation of his friend and should have shown more trust in you. But we are humans and we do make mistakes. Also Huge ones. But before listening to some strangers who all just tell you the easy way to divorce, I would say, you shouldn't rush into it. Yes you're husband was a doush, and what he did was totally inappropriate. And as you say, he also didn't give you a fair chance. But what does a logging time into a game really prove? Honestly, I wouldn't count that as a prove. In court you wouldn't be able to prove anything with it. And of course Jef won't say he slept with my wife etc. that's just thoughts, I would have, when I was told my wife is cheating. So the worst your husband messed up with this is, he made you do a risky parental test. I can't say why he did that. Maybe that's the first thing he read online when he started looking. The DNA blood test is pretty new in medicine. It's not the first thing to pop up when you look for a prenatal parental test. And of course, since you tried to proof your husband your faithfulness, you could have also checked for other ways to prove him wrong. You could have also checked for a different prenatal parental test or tell him to wait till birth. You knew the kid was his, so you would have had all rights to make him wait till birth, to make a parental test. I really don't want to put any blame on you here and don't mean to offend you. I am just trying to show you, that there is more to think about. You can hate me for my comments. I'm fine with that, but I'm only trying to make an objective and rational picture in your case. I'm not on your husbands site. I think he totally messed up on that. But as it is said He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her. We all do mistakes. I think you should at least give him a chance to rebuilt trust or at least show him he has changed. I don't say to do it right now and I don't say to go back to him. Take all the time you need. It seems to me the wounds in your soul are very fresh and bleed very bad. Give it some time and think about it. Maybe it's worth to go the hard way, to have some struggle but then again come up with a strong relationship. It's a tough way, but life has no easy ways to offer. So please don't get me wrong, I'm not putting any blame on you. You did the right thing to leave him for now and take your time to think and also show him, that he can't do with you as he likes. Your not his puppet. I'm just trying to show you the picture, how it might look from the site of your husband. I wish you and your child deeply the best. You didn't deserve to be treated like that.

"There are so much to baseball, and it's subtle.  The key to baseball is that in the heart of the game is a player vs player one on one duel pitcher versus hitter .  It helps the drama if you know the players to know their strength and weaknesses...so I suggest picking an MLB team, a local team, and following them and watching them, and reading about your team in the local paper (online anyway).  You'll get to know about them.   This will help you understand some of the moves of the games, or the threat of a move by the manager (head coach in other sports), so you can understand and appreciate the game if you are watching high school, or college or a minor league game.   Part of the beauty of the game is the pace.  It's slower, deliberate, like a summer evening.  Enjoy that, it's not continuous adrenaline, it's not meant to be.

"John, I had to come back to respond to this.  Your citing Teddy Roosevelt really got under my skin.  I memorized that quote you cited shortly after joining the military and have reflected on it often.  It has been a comfort during hard times, like when one of my buddies from training [was killed](http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2012/11/watchung_hills_graduate_killed.html) in combat.  You have no idea what real sacrifice is or what real problems in the world look like.    What sacrifice have you made?  Getting excommunicated from the LDS church isn't a sacrifice.  I'll probably be excommunicated too, won't see me seeking praise for it.  Unlike you though I'm not cowardly throwing spears from the outside while I collect a six figure salary in donations.  You made a literal financial profit off your excommunication.  Gee, that must be nice.    I respect what you think you're trying to do, but you are deluded and it's down right offensive for you to invoke the Man In The Area.  Let me take you to the middle east on a field trip and I'll show you what real sacrifice looks like.  Hell, let me take you on a field trip here in the USA.  If there was ever an example of first-world problems and white privilege, it's Mormon Stories and the whole uber-liberal/progressive branch of the exmormon/anti-Mormon movement.   Not that those problems aren't real, but that they are sissy problems in the context of REAL problems out in the REAL world.  You are no Rosa Parks.  You are no Martin Luther King.  You're an indian throwing spears at a barbie castle.  An indian that is actually a white dude with makeup on being paid to throw spears.    The simple fact is I don't trust you.  And I don't trust you because your actions are plainly dishonest.  Standing up for truth, that's great.  I'm all about the truth.  So stop lying.  An 84 page book isn't a fucking letter.  Jeremy and his whole story is a yarn of lies.  The ""letter"" itself engages in quite a bit of dishonesty.  Like there is really any shock Jeremy is getting the boot?  LOL, his actions fit the dictionary definition of apostasy.  And even putting all that aside, your tactics are hostile, mean-spirited, and ultimately ineffective.  All you're doing is giving life to the negative exmormon/anti stereotypes.  You are feeding the persecution complex.    We can't force anybody to de-convert anymore than we could force anybody to convert on our missions.  As a psychologist I would expect you to understand this.  I gotta be honest, this anti-Mormonism is so over the line it makes me want to go back to church.  Not because I believe in it, but because I'd rather stand with them than you.  If it's a war, I'm with them.  Mormons are a teeny minority of the population and I'll defend their right to live in peace.    Blah blah blah, why am I still here talking about this getting sucked right back in?  ",-6

"&gt;&gt;You have groups like Hamas who go out and kill 90% soldiers (in the latest war for example) and they are the terrorists who target civilians. Israel goes out and kills 75% civilians and they are the good guys who have one of the best civilian to militant ratios in the world. Make sense? Of course if you take the broader context of Hamas' actions, especially the suicide bombings that stopped in the mid 2006s, you would have to come to the conclusion that they are a terrorist organization. And that's a fair label - if it's applied equally to the other side which it never is.  You're saying Israel should be labelled as a terrorist organization?

"You guys have a very different definition of what the right to bare arms means. Every last right in the U.S. comes with exceptions. Freedom of speech doesn't mean you can run into a crowded theatre and yell 'Active shooter!"" or ""Fire!"" The 4th amendment is completely disregarded if your local police force has probable cause. The Fifth Amendment guarantees a trial by jury but the justice system pushes for confessions almost 90% of the time.   To me the ability to own a firearm at all is the right to bare arms. I'm not saying I agree with gun laws that limit mag size or AR/SBR bans. I'm saying that if your country allows you to own a firearm, and an SBR which are illegal in many states in the U.S., then you're afforded freedoms with firearms that many people do not have in a nation that is considered ""liberal"". Meaning, there is a party for you to vote for unlike in the U.S. where you are limited to, supposedly a person who wants to get rid of all guns (meanwhile no ""liberal"" president has ever completely gotten rid of the 2nd amendment) but agrees with universal healthcare, and a guy who wants privatized healthcare and doesn't want to get rid of guns (but isn't going to repeal the existing gun laws while in office anyways).   And may main point is too is that while the rest of you are throwing a fit the minute Obama says ""Guns"" and running out to replenish your ammo stocks you're ignoring the fact that through many decades of ""liberal"" presidencies not one time has any federal agent come into your home to confiscate your weapons, even if laws were passed limiting mag sizes. When they passed that dumb law in CT after Sandy Hook the state didn't even come to me and ask me to prove that I had destroyed my G17's factory magazine or had turned it in. They didn't send a state police officer to my home.   I think a part of the reason the rhetoric between those who believe in banning firearms all together and those that don't falls apart is because of hard liners on both sides. Why can't we have rational and professional discourse on the issue? Why can't we come to compromises? NFAs are perfectly okay. I don't want fully automatic weapons in the hands of violent felons or terrorists. I don't see why I shouldn't have to pass a background check to own a firearm even though the NRA purports that they do nothing to prevent crimes with guns. If you have to pass a background check to get a job, own a home, or get a credit card then why not a background check to own a firearm?   But instead of sitting at the table and saying ""Here's what we're asking, can you adhere to it? And if not can you tell us why? Can you show us research that proves that a very small to almost non-existent amount of legally registered gun owners commit violent crimes with their weapons? Can you reaffirm the fact that if someone who lives in a state with ammo capacity laws they can easily just buy magazines in a neighboring state with more relaxed gun laws? That evil psychopaths will find a will and a way if they want to commit some awful act?""  Instead the rhetoric from the pro gun side is usually ""SCALIA CROAKED, LOCK YOUR DOORS, THEY CAN TAKE MY GUN FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"".  And furthermore, with all those billions in profit that gun and ammo manufacturers are making right now due to people's idiocy how about they pay some taxes to develop an easy to use national database that provides up to date information on background checks? A fucking mobile phone app where vendors even at gun shows could easily type in your name and DOB and maybe a (scoffs) license to own and purchase firearms number into a database that shows you haven't had any psych admissions recently, haven't committed a violent crime or a felony recently, and therefore are safe to purchase a firearm?  But every time these measures are hinted at being implemented a subset of whackjobs freaks the fuck out about their 2nd amendment rights being pissed on by homosexual Muslims, and the next course of action is to break down your door, take all your guns, and force your children, male or female, to marry a 50 year old Muslim man.  Maybe if we sat at the table and agreed to some of these measures some of these anti-gun politicians would say ""Man, this SBR/AR/ammo capacity law is really ineffective and we should just get rid of it.""

"&gt;Source or it's no better than if I say men should not be in power because they are classically aggressive and putting them in charge or countries leads to war.  You have to be aggressive in order to not be exterminated by a rival civilization.  Wars are fought for resources and humans are animals.   &gt;Assuming that you are right about how women are (you aren't), empathizing with the ""enemy"" might be a good trait to have in our increasingly globalized economy and world stage. Hopefully, the time of huge conquering powers is over.  OP is basing his post on  statistics that indicates that men are less supportive of multiculturalism compared to women.

From where I'm sitting, we aren't living in a tribal society where Russia is going to kick down our door and take our women.   Russia is weak and it's easier that the US could take their women and Siberia's resources.

Hopefully, the time of huge conquering powers is over.  Life is hard and humans are egoistical beings, the geopolitical board is more like a children's playground than a utopic peaceful garden.  Again people fight wars for resources.  &gt;Hopefully, the time of huge conquering powers is over.  They will return, someday humans will always be humans. The reason that the european countries are not fighting like they used to is that wars are costly and the benefits don't outweigh the benefits derived from commerce during peace times.    The ME wars are fought for influence and resources the tide of this wars will determine the balance of power between the stronger countries.  Personally I don't love multiculturalism because it breeds further division between human beings and this division is ammunition for further conflict (and tyrants). The scandinavian countries with their homogeneity are great examples. You can appreciate other cultures without the need that have these people in your own country.    edit: (and tyrants)",-9

"I would totally agree that cutting jobs is something bad.  But outsourcing them has some positive effects despite people loosing their jobs. Firstly it creates new jobs in other countries. Secondly companies do save money and maybe hire new workers in other fields or they invest their saved money which also creates jobs.  But your social aspect is certainly true because in countries like China work conditions are disastrous (eg Foxconn).  Nonetheless to my mind we should see outsourcing through the eyes of third and second world countries as well. ",-7

"NA said EU had 1 good team last year until NA were annihilated and embarrassed in groups.   Even last year in Spring split FNC had many losses, but apparently in IMT with 3 worse players, they're stomping Spring split w/o competition. Just goes to show a worrying trend in NA. Do you honestly think you'll have success internationally?   We've already seen Huni &amp; RO throwing big leads and being the weakest links at Worlds for FNATIC when facing top tier competition.  Pob isn't even top 10 in the West. Any mid laner could do what he does. Sit back and get carried. Shit on EG/WFX - goes to CLG and looks average. Gets placed in the easiest group with the less good mid laners at Worlds, and looks the worst out of any of them. Literally had 0 % carry potential. Febiven carried his team, Pobelter sucked and couldn't keep up with any of the group A midlaners. xD  Not to mention WT was the worst ADC in the entire Summer split last year. He fell behind in CS every game, even in the games they lane swapped. Also he's positioner.  FNC barely passed groups at Worlds, how'd IMT's do with a worse lineup? ",-7

"Prozac was tested recently and found to be no better than placebo.  &gt;Why are inert pills suddenly overwhelming promising new drugs and established medicines alike? The reasons are only just beginning to be understood. A network of independent researchers is doggedly uncovering the inner workings—and potential therapeutic applications—of the placebo effect. At the same time, drugmakers are realizing they need to fully understand the mechanisms behind it so they can design trials that differentiate more clearly between the beneficial effects of their products and the body's innate ability to heal itself.  https://archive.wired.com/medtech/drugs/magazine/17-09/ff_placebo_effect?currentPage=all  It turns out that the expensive pharmaceutical drugs may not be any better than homeopathy, and because homeopathic remedies are inert, they can not cause side effects.

I think it is understood that a lot of medicine that has been produced in the last century or so is based off the known medicinal properties of plants, leaves, and other natural sources (white willow bark in aspirin, to name one). This study does make a good point that there are a LARGE number of copycat or generic homeopathic companies that are not putting out a quality product. This is all true for pharmaceuticals. Those who use homeopathy should not be discouraged from treatment, but you need to make sure you are ingesting a quality product that you know will be effective as prescribed by a reputable homeopath or natural professional. From a purely scientific standpoint though, it can be easily seen that this study is very much inconclusive and not reputable. If this review was directed towards modern medicine, the language would be tossed out the window by professionals. ",-14

"First, there are still a lot of good resources online that can contribute towards social mobility for anyone who can access them.   Secondly, the trouble of books and other media online is sort of complicated. You could have a system where anyone with a library card can read books for free for a certain time period, or provide income-proportional discounts for textbooks / books with the purpose of educating. The trouble becomes that the library model isn't scalable when you consider that the cost of printing/publishing/storing books is all but eliminated. So while your local library may only have two copies of that book you want and you'll just have to wait they're returned, there's no limit online to how many books a digital library can obtain and distribute. Unfortunately, authors still need to be compensated for their time and effort. So... I'm not even sure what point I'm trying to make anymore, libraries are tricky because books are just information and we can distribute them without cost, but to hold onto the old model of subsidizing the purchase of hard copies to distribute to the public seems unnecessarily restrictive.

"&gt; *When I was in school* it was only a ""bully""  I don't think the definition has changed so much as you have grown up. Kids may only call physical violence bullying, but that doesn't mean the only kind of bullying is physical violence.  [Here are the criteria for bullying as set out in one psychological paper on the subject](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13632752.2013.844414#.VrO3FVgrJhE):  1. An intention to harm: intention suggests that the harm caused by bullying is deliberate, not accidental.  2. Victimization distress: bullying can cause the victim to suffer mild to severe psychological, social or physical trauma. 3. Repetition: bullying is persistent; it happens more than once or has the potential to occur multiple times. 4. Power inequity: definitions of bullying often state that bullying includes a real or perceived imbalance of power between the bully and the victim. Wikipedia notes that [this characteristic is disputed](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13632752.2013.844414#.VrO36FgrJhE), as both bullies and victims have reported that the conflict and/or behaviours most commonly occur between two equals. 5. Provocation: bullying is proposed to be a part of progressive aggression: motivated by perceived benefits of their aggressive behaviours.",-6

I don't go watch the Avengers for blood and violence I go for good action. If I wanted to watch something graphic I can see a Tarantino Film or other R rated films that are constantly being released. That's even ignoring comedies which are almost always rated R.  But the point is you don't really have an argument. You say you just want more R-rated movies, even though there are plenty released every year. You also say blood and violence doesn't make a movie but then follow it up by saying the realism makes movies better so isn't that kind of a contradiction?  Finally I don't think you really explain why pg-13 is bad. The Dark Knight is pg-13. Lord of the Rings is Pg-13. Honestly most of my favourite action movies are made with a pg-13 rating because it's fun an enjoyable. There isn't any reason for those movies to be more violent than they already are.  So why should Hollywood insert graphic violence into fun action movies, does it improve them at all? Would Lord of the Rings be a better movie with gratuitous violence? Or the Dark Knight?

You couldn't make it part of the hashing algorithm anyway unless it's some brand new algorithm that could provide support for session like information but I'm not sure how that could even work unless it was also built into a secure enclave (which nothing in the iPhone 5C is).  Like I said this is how it's implemented everywhere that has a password input delay after X amount of tries. If there is some fancier, more secure way to implement this then please let me know as I would love to learn about it but I have not heard of it and it would need to somehow tie the user's sessions to the hashing algorithm but not modify the output of the algorithm itself which would be very interesting.",-10

It was a smart play on all sides.  Bonus, Obama got Hillary as SecState, where she did a fantastic job.  And Hillary got to rid Obama's popularity into the '16 nomination as the presumed frontrunner.",-9

I think that the reason why you don't see men involved in the family is because in many areas family doesn't really include men. And as for the custody situation what you are saying is not true. In my state men do not receive custody of the child. The only time a man receives custody of the child in my state is when a woman does not want custody or when she is deemed uncapable of taking care of the child. I have actually seen and heard this played out in the courts and I am NOT talking about for myself. I have watched in countless situations children be dangled like a pawn in front of men who don't want to be with a particular woman anymore as leverage. They can do this due to the inequal handling of child custody.   Also as I stated in my original post my intention was not to answer your question but you simply explain that aspect of what he was talking about. It resonated with what I have seen in many situations among the people I have known in my life. I think the relation to the original post is that he feels that in many aspects of life men are not expected to fulfil any useful role. They can't be affectionate to their friends. They aren't expected to be a father to your child and are often look at strangely when they are.  I know don't want to deal with what I see men with families deal with everyday.,-7

Cutting you off may not be cool, but everything that followed was your fault.   Edit: Brake checking is not against the law where I live.

"Melee players always feel like they have to shit on Smash 4 for some reason. I think part of it is them feeling threatened since that last time a new game in the smash series was released their game almost died (which is silly given that as far as the player base is concerned there is little overlap between players) and part is them feeling like Smash 4 is too ""new"" to have the success it does. At this point I think that it's fairly obvious to most people that Smash 4's existence isn't causing anything harmful for melee and that the Smash 4 scene has attracted a lot of attention towards the Smash scene in general. I don't think it's a coincidence that Melee's explosion in popularity sort of coincided with the release of Smash 4. (Compare Melee Evo entrants in 2014 vs 2015) Yeah it was increasing before then but I believe that Smash 4's release had a fairly large part in Melee's explosion in the past 2 years.  I feel like most Smash 4 players at this point know that for the forseeable future 4 is always going to be second banana to Melee. They get special events like Dreamhack and Smash Summit. They always get the better timeslot for events like Evo. And for the most part everyone is alright with that. It gets a bit more viewers and has worked hard to get where it is now.

"I will quote the words of a friend who is also local and put it really well. ""There are other issues here besides whether her actions deserve being fired. Specifically that the curators technically don't have the power to fire her. She did not get due process. There should be a lawsuit and it is causing faculty to question academic freedom which, under threat, has many far reaching consequences for teaching and knowledge production.""  There was a group of protestors who were addressing racial issues at the college. As students I think they have a right to protest and a right to get an education. The professor didn't handle herself perfectly (she is human after all) but she felt drawn to protect these students who felt marginalized. I don't fault her for that.  The Missouri State Legislature was responding in an outrageous way by demanding she be fired and by withholding funds they promised to the school unless she be fired. The state tried to pass laws against student athletes protesting or to fine a football coach for supporting those students.  When you have a politicians in the State capital that get to decide which professors should be fired or not, isn't that a serious issue? I don't know about anyone else but that scares me. Our GOP has a bust of Rush Limbaugh in one of their buildings in the state capital here. Those guys should not decide who teaches college students (or not). And neither should Democrats either.

"There's an important ambiguity in your comments here that should be clarified.  When you use the word ""ban"" are you referring to:  **1\.** Official subreddit bannings where a user is sent a PM saying ""you have been banned from posting to /r/science etc.""  or   **2\.** Automod subreddit bans where all of  a user's posts and comments are automatically removed by Automod as soon as they are posted. This isn't technically an official banning,  but in practice has almost the same effect, and is often referred to as a ""banning"" or an ""automod banning"".  I get the feeling there are semantic games being played here in order to obfuscate.  So when you say, for example, ""calmly explained to several of the posters that there exists no ban whatsoever against them"" do you mean ""no Official Ban against them"" or ""no Automod Ban against them""?

Official facebook pages are marked with a blue check thing):  &gt; Benny &amp; Rafi Fine here to clear the confusion and answer your questions - please reply to this thread and we will be answering throughout the day. Please see below to clarify what React World is.  &gt;1: We do not hold a copyright on reaction videos overall. No one can. It isn’t something you can copyright.  &gt;2: We are not going after/shutting down/sueing anyone who makes reaction based content. We are licensing our specific shows and their structural elements.  &gt; 3: On the confusion around what we mean by our “format” we do NOT mean “people reacting to videos” we mean the structural elements of the FBE series. Most series have protectable elements, which is why you see multiple shows across entertainment that have the same idea, but a different presentation. The FBE series (Such as “Kids React”, “Lyric Breakdown”, &amp; “Do They Know It?,"" and elements like their title cards, timing, graphical elements, etc. which is what you are licensing in terms of what we mean by “format”.  &gt;4: We don’t like to make parallels to TV but think of it like this. You have a TV network in another country and want to make a singing show. You can make a brand new format on your own and come up with every aspect of that series and hope it works out (and it might do great) or you can pay to license an established brand (like an “American Idol”) and make a your version which could increase your chances of success as well as give you the tools to produce the series efficiently.  &gt;To us, this is a way to connect with our viewers and allow people to make their own version of a show they love to watch. Again we’ll be replying in this thread if there are further questions.  Seems like they just don't like people copying things and were trying to build a brand. Which is reasonable.",-29

They were tossing debris at that general area where they can hit either the downed cop, or the two standing cops–their goal, hit cops. It wasn't because HEY, LOOK AT THAT ONE WITH THE GLASSES, FOCUS FIRE ON HIM! They aren't organized like that... It was thrown in the general area with three cops that people can see. No one said ""over there"" or ""him!"" or ""her!"" it was just people saw people threw. You guys are acting as if there's some personal intent in hurting that ONE cop when it was thrown to hurt all cops. I'm not saying this is OK... but you're giving them too much credit.

"Well generally speaking, I don't think a huge majority of writers understand the first thing about writing since they read Piercy Jackson and was like ""OH MY GOSH THAT WAS AMAZING."" And then proceed to never look critically at any story telling medium, truth be told. Book readers are generally the best audience to get criticisms from, considering they've read a lot of books and had to develop a preference over time because they can't just read the the same book over and over again, and you can't read the books that are too similar for a very long time before it gets boring. Pointing out that they don't explain why, whilst the information points to scrutiny and simplicity. Is like saying ""People get cancer because he their fat."" there's no context, and so we are left to believe it's not possible given the information we already know. Minor inconsistencies like that? They leave too much to the imagination, I'll put it like this. For characters if you don't describe how they are. Then it's up to your imagination to fill in the missing bits. So if lets say a book isn't well written, yes we get the message, the story. But we don't know that.  So how does that translate to reality, lots of mistakes in movies. So if we don't see it, we don't hear it. We will think about it. Every little thing like the weather and the feeling of the mood. Not important, something crucial to the characters, story, or plot? Is important. Because seeing as this maybe a mystery novel, a person who is a detective may not take this lightly. So... it makes it seem unrealistic. But old photos of older people who look like someone else in the current age? Plausible. I once had a person I know who looked younger look exactly like Brad Pitt from fight club, and he was born maybe in the 1930's? He was in the cold war so.....",-16

"The Bible does call for the execution of homosexuals. It also calls for the execution of people that pick up sticks on the Sabbath, for witches, for unmarried women who have had sex with a man, for unruly children.  If the death penalty for being unruly as a child were enforced I doubt any of us would be alive today.  That is one of the many reasons we and other industrialized nations have secular governments. Following religious law is disgusting to most civilized societies so they are moving farther and farther away from the Bible, particularly the OT.  I must say, I am so thankful you guys do not follow God's law. It shows a far finer moral sense to my mind.   Of course if we were to start killing homosexuals it would include all those who have thought about it. Some interpret homosexuality to include those that masterbate so we would have to kill all those people. And then there are all those that have thought about masterbating, we must not forget them.   Ok I have changed my mind. I am converted. Let's start killing homosexuals, adulterers and unruly children. Who is with me?",-15
"Well OP, this is not good. About all you can do is to give her space to decide what she wants and use that (time and) space to work on yourself. Domestic violence and/or anger management counselling plus therapy is necessary. Maintain sobriety as you will be labile (emotionally) throughout this time and you do not want alcohol or drugs impacting your decision-making process.  I am not as pessimistic as the other commenters about the chances of saving your marriage. 8 years is a long time.  I used to work in ""domestic conflict"" court and it was a regular occurrence to see couples who reconciled wherein the guy did worse things than you. I am not saying that is necessarily a good thing but it is a fact. Putting aside the morals and politics of this, you still do have a shot.  Do what you need to do and let her have the controls of your relationship. If you are lucky enough to get a chance to make amends, do so and NEVER, ever lay a hand on her again.    Edit: providing facts gets you down-voted huh. Just to be clear you self-righteous idiots, I was the prosecutor for domestic court trying to put guys in jail for this.

Using the League of Nations as justification for the creation of Israel is like using the UN resolution calling Zionism racism.  The League of Nations was simply put, the winners club for WW1.  It had no moral legitimacy to carve up the middle east just so Europeans could get rid of their Jews.  &gt; Its creation was not a crime, the Palestinian and Arab aggression against Israel was.

"Try to think about it critically.  Many multiplayer games have an expected life span of several years. For example, getting Battlefield 4 was a safe bet since you could be confident that Battlefield 5 was not coming out the following year. Why? Because Battlefield isn't a yearly franchise.  Theoretically, after several years of playing Battlefield 4, you would have gotten what some people call ""their money's worth"" and those people would be ready for a sequel that reiterates and improves on the previous title.  A Call of Duty game is an annual franchise, therefore with most of its entries a significant portion of its userbase moves onto the next entry every year. To keep with the most populated and competitive userbase, you would also have to follow suit.  Now think about why the two are different. Why buying a game intended to last indefinitely is different from buying a game designed to be obsolete after 2 years at **most.**  Are you able to figure it out, or do I have to spell it out for you?",-15

It's like  ""I like the convenience of sitting on the couch.""  You can do that with pc.  ""I don't like keyboard/mouse.""  You can play with controllers on pc.  ""I already have a laptop.""

"Actually not as horrible as I was expecting. I think anyone honest about race can recognize that minorities have been and are discriminated against and held back, and are told all the while that not being the picture of success is entirely their own fault, you know, because of role models and rap. But the problem with the white privilege argument is the failure to recognize that the vast majority of whites aren't given a small loan of a million dollars just for showing up.  We are all eating a shit sandwich here, but just remember that your struggles don't negate the struggles of someone else. Just because you worked yourself up from the trailer park does not mean redlining home loans didn't catastrophically affect the black community, for instance. That's just something whites never had to deal with. And just because minorities had it rough does not mean whites can't have it rough either.   I think we can recognize systematic discrimination against minorities by whites without taking it so personally. But ultimately, people will take this video to mean what they want it to mean, and that's unfortunate.",-8

Why not just let them be then. If they are such a voiced and actioned threat, then well geez, seems like a legitimate reason to bomb that regime to pieces. nothing we haven't done before.  We argue about their military capability and prowess yet at the same time laugh away any serious thoughts of them as a threat because they have such underdeveloped technology. supposedly can't even build a rocket that will span continents but have sent a few rockets into orbit now, a couple carrying satellites. NK is treated as this looming threat that has not only voiced it's spite felt from sanctions but has voiced intentions that should be considered words of war by any official, meanwhile everyone is ok with running over to Afghanistan and Iraq where entirely less legitimate reasoning to do so has yet to surface, officially. It's like whuuut NK? ok fine, you want to be stubborn and somehow eventually find a way to make NK strong and independent like lets say Germany pre WW2? cool good luck with  that, but everyone else either needs to 'do something about it' if they are so inclined, or just chill the fuck out and let the outcast do his thing.",-11

"5 ranked games is more than enough to do a good job playing any champion except a few. Something like zed, lb, ori, syndra, azir... you don't pick up instantly, but if you can't play something like 80% of the other champions to a decent level you have some serious problems....  There are a LOT of shit to know about league, but champions are fairly simple. 4 abilities, one passive. If after 2 hours of play time you still can't play it in ranked at a decent level then ranked queue just isn't for you.  Up until high Diamond (approx. because I can only face diamonds &amp; up players in normals) your skills with the champ don't actually matter, and that's why you can play AD katarina and completely carry the game.  What I think people don't realise is the only change isn't really their ability but more so the way they think when not playing their main. You have a lot less confidence because you aren't ""on your main"", so your decision making takes a hit, and you suck. Self-fulfilling prophecy. ",-9

"One question - does anything deserve gold?  I've been observing reddit for a very long time, and I am absolutely sick of the continued monopoly the creator is making on this site. Once, this subreddit was a beautiful place. Then, reddit gold was brought in. It was an interesting thing that everyone had low expectations for, and yet it funded reddit and everyone like it.   Now, I just feel like reddit is being endorsed and paid for by third parties. All this continued hidden and very open advertising, the political agendas and the sexual innuendos (though unrelated) are making me absolutely fucking sick, and it absolutely sickens me that this could continue happen.   You know reddit isn't the first type of website like this to ever exist, right? We had a predecessor - Digg. Google it buddy. It was a prime and fantastic subreddit, but it fell and was succeeded by reddit because the owners did shitty things. Reddit is going on a similar course and has been for ages. There was almost a complete strike - people went to other sites like Digg and Empeopled and were hoping everyone else would leave reddit too. But for some strange reason, reddit bounced back and now Voat became the successor for all the dirty subreddits that became outlawed here. THEY OUTLAWED OUR SUBREDDITS, AND WE JUST ACCEPTED IT. ",-8

"Ok, lets do this. basic third grade math, but what ever.   adult human should weigh around 80 kg, lets round up to 90 kg because he wears clothing and 100 kg because he is on a drone.  ( trick I learned from several exes, badum-tish)  Now, we have to do a bit of trickery, because the hypeman did not show up exctly how many engines are on the board. But, since we know the weight of the payload ( human + clothing + quadcopter) we have an idea that 5 engines on each side , 10 total, all doing the spinny sounds reasonable.   A basic GED tells us 10 engines share their work, ao each engine has to lift 10 kg from the ground in order to compete.   Now, 10 kg is outside most hobbyist means, but just to show you how the math is done:   http://www.himodel.com/electric/HL_W51-34_350KV_Outrunner_Brushless_Disk_Type_Motor_for_Multi-rotor_6S_3Kg.html this is usually what buying an engine like this looks like. Now, first thing on the page that looks cool is the diagramm. this shows us the pull per watt the engine generates.   Now, instead of really really weird math acrobatics, uit is pretty much straightforwards   - You find out how heavy everything taken together is ( in our case, 100 kg).   - you apply some cigrettes, a bottle of rum, and some pinkillers, and you end up with some calculated values, because the replica helicopter fanbase solved the equasions before the eggheads and drone hipsters stormed the scene.....  Hovering: 100-150 Watt/kg ScaleFlight: 200-300 Watt/kg Some chilling acrobatic flight: 350-400 Watt/kg 3D acrobatics 500+ Watt/kg Hardcore 3D 1000 Watt/kg   you then pick what I think is a fair value ( chill acrobatic flight, with enough room to spare), and you end up with 400 watts per KG, leaving us with 40.000 watts. per ((corrected thanks to the watchfull eyes of /u/TheSelfGoverned into )) second.  Sure, you can argue that better engines work smarter, but hell, I worked with what was there, not with what I could imagine.   Happy battery hunting.

If Dota were to released in 2015 w/o it's legacy, right behind LoL's shadow, people will just try and forget it like a week or month. As like above, Volvo's just cashing and see's the opportuniy to make money out of it, nothing wrong seriously.  &gt; Turbine's development cycle  Uh huh, again timing is everything. If Dota was released in 2015 with this current patch frequency, it will be further buried down the MOBA market.  &gt;Split the already small community  Whatever, gotta start small somewhere.  &gt;The Gambit Meta  As if Dota din't copy most of it's skills from Warcraft itself, then again lots of skills are quite common in MMOs and games in general.

"The terrorists (happy?) in Iraq &amp;amp;amp; Afghanistan didn't have access to any of those things either. In fact, their weapons were even more crude and they *still* held off the full force of the US military for over a decade.   Let me quote another comment from Reddit since your tired and fact free argument seems to be coming up a lot recently.  We've been getting our asses kicked strategically for over a decade by goat fuckers with ancient weapons cobbled together in a Fallout 4 style workshops, yet here we are with people thinking our military is an unstoppable force because of its tech.   Let's take a look at wars fought between an overwhelming more powerful and technological advanced military vs armed rebels.  1.) Russian invasion of Afghanistan 1979-1989       Result = Afghan rebel victory  2.) French-indochina war 1946-1954       Result = Vietnamese rebel victory  3.) Vietnam War 1964-1973       Result = Vietnamese victory  4.) Western intervention in Afghanistan 2001-present  Result = war is still going, with it being in favor of the Taliban currently  5.) Iraq War 2003-2014       Result = Pyrrhic victory, Iraq still heavily unstable with areas of the country under the control of rebel groups   That's just a few of the most well-known wars in which vastly superior military forces were defeated by a much smaller, less armed, and untrained rebel forces. I could add in the many other failed counter-insurgency wars fought by nations against rebel groups as there are so many that have occured in the 20th and 21st century. What many people don't realise is how wars are won by insurgents. It's not through force-on-force but hit and run and other forms of guerilla warfare tactics. It's how the mujihadeen beat the Soviets and how the Vietcong beat the US military.  The right to bear arms is incredibly important in defending the citizens rights against corrupt government. Why do you think almost every dictator in the 20th and 21st century banned firearms as soon as they gain power? It's to eliminate the people's ability to rise up and remove them from power.   This is a perfect example of the fucking idiot down voting retards on this site. ""We don't like that you have rights and we sure don't like your opinion."" *down vote*",-6

Even in the few cases that the snitched on person doesnt personally retaliate, the snitch usually has to deal with being ostracized from his friend group who now knows that they cannot be trusted.  Hell, I've seen quite a few incidents where a snitch is attacked by people that dont even know the person that was snitched on, and only attack because they have heard that person was a snitch.  Most of the ones I know about snitched on someone they knew though, but there are plenty out there that would go after someone for doing what op did.  A good example of this can be found in inner cities, just check out any of the real crime tv shows for examples.

"I would love to hear the husbands side of things. His side that is said without fear of being told his feelings are gross or invalid.  The things he looked up are taboo, yes, and maybe even shocking, but it seems like he has this whole secret/private-place persona that is likely bred out of shame and insecurity. You say he can watch porn and do this or that, but then when you find out what sort of porn he is searching for, you flip out and threaten him. While you have a right to object and be shocked, the way you reacted to your findings only reaffirms his reasons for why he must hide these things in the first place.  When people aren't allowed to be freely curious, those curiosities often tend to take on a life of their own. The life grows into this private behind-the-scenes identity that one will act-out and nourish without fear of being told they are wrong. That persona will be very dissociative, too -- it's them, but they don't really perceive it as ""real,"" thus, it is not subject to consequence. This also includes the sexting.  To him, this hidden persona is merely a playground of exploration and not his true self, there are no consequences for the sexting or the taboo porn because it's ""not real"" to him, it's just another avenue of his fantasy exploration.   &amp;nbsp; With that said, the reasons behind his actions are perhaps neither here nor there from your point of view: He obviously has done things you don't like, and you're entitled to feel that way.  Its up to you whether any of this is a deal breaker, but I'd recommend taking a breather and a step back before making any rash decisions. The mind is a creepy and amazing place; people will always be curious and wonder about things. The internet gives us a doorway to feed our curiosities and sometimes people just need a safe place to find the answers to their questions. If those answers can be answered without the person being made to feel shame, usually the curiosities will be satisfied and pass. I think in this situation, the most concerning thing is the sexting -- I do wonder just how far he has gone with that and if the fantasies have manifested to real life. Whether the sexting is a dissociative act for [i]him[/i]or not, I think most people would consider that cheating. ",-9

Then perhaps I could avoid weirdness between me and this girl. I don't know.   I'd worry about the girl, feel ashamed about what I did when horny, be scared I'd wreck my friendship with her parents, and I'd not know what would be the best thing to do or say. I'd just want her to know this is a risk. I'd be freaked out on her behalf.   edit: I might add.. If other people that know her see her, perhaps they'll do worse things.

"&gt;&gt; But why? If the Xbox has all the games on the PC marketplace (and the 360 and the rumoured original Xbox), how would that separate it from the others so much so that you wouldn't even consider it?  &gt;Because I buy consoles based on exclusives, like most people I know do. I own an Xbox specifically for Halo, as well as other stuff I am excited for like QB and Scalebound.  And they'll still be playable on the Xbox platform.  &gt; I own a Wii U for Xenoblade and Fire Emblem. I own a PS4 for Uncharted 4 and Horizon and Persona 5.  Thats great.   &gt; Multiplatform games I will buy on PS4 or XBO depending on which console I would own. And if most or all XBO exclusives are on PC, then I wouldnt consider buying an Xbox if I am making a console choice  But they'll be exclusive between Xbox and PC and *only* Xbox and PC. So unless you have a gaming PC as well, you'll still be missing out on all those exclusives. And if you do, then it means you won't have to buy a third console to enjoy the games or the services and social aspects. So it's a win win for you. Still not sure why you're complaining. ",-6

When I check Wikipedia I have most of the symptoms but it's a big assertion to diagnose a mental disorder. Mental disorders aren't about finding out what's wrong with a person, it's about getting them proper care and y'all keep spreading unsubstantiated mental health claims besides from some nobody who used to be Kanye's friend.   As someone who struggles with mental health it's insulting people use these insinuations as some type of ammunition against Kanye while pretending like its for his own good. If you don't like an album that's fine but using mental health as a reason why is a cop-out to avoid the possibility that it might have gone over your head and you might have to actually think critically about the album. But of course there's no way Kanye is that deep it's a better use of time to stab in the dark about what mental illness someone you don't like has. Smh @ all y'all. ",-6

Some players like to improve and will try to help regardless of the condition they are placed, others will simply leech because they think draco is easy and since everybody does it, then so can they.

"So basically his arguments against trump are:   1: He takes small donations from people and is in fact not 100% self funded  Even though a vast majority of his campaign is self funded. Okay.. is that a bad thing? If so, may I point out how much money Hillary and Bernie are taking in donations? Why aren't you pointing them out also? Oh yeah you're liberal propaganda. Unbiased sources are supposed to point out both sides not just one.   2: He loves threatening to sue people  As opposed to Hillary who loves being under investigation by 4 different agencies for her crimes. Oh yeah Trump's so horrible for wanting to sue people which is an American right to do. Is John Oliver against the Constitution and against people being able to defend themselves in court? checks his thoughts on wanting guns to be banned oh of course he is against the Constitution, why did I even ask?   3: Some of his companies have went bankrupt  Yeah that's business. You cut your losses and start up the company again. He wasn't personally bankrupt... So now you're trying to attack him for what? For cutting his losses and not sticking with it and losing even more money? You'd have to be an idiot to do that.   4: His net worth might, possibly, may, could be more than hundreds of millions and not billions  And how much money do the other candidates have. Are you saying having small amounts of money is a bad thing, Mr. Oliver? is that the argument you're trying to make? Looks at Bernie   5: Some of his businesses ex. Trump magazine, Trump vodka etc. have been discontinued/folded  Okay? Is an entrepreneur not allowed to have some businesses fail especially when you have so many? How are the other candidates businesses doing? lol Again he just keeps pointing out personal things that have nothing to do with being president. What does this have to do with anything john?   6: 2 trump hotels weren't built, so the investors sued him and he settled  Woah so like he was doing his business and 2 investments weren't made so he paid off the investors losses. WOOOOAAAHHH are you saying he was doing his job?!??!!?!! what an outrage   7: He's changed his political stance a few times  Ahem look at Hillary.   8: He didn't condemn someone that he didn't know who happened to be in the KKK therefore Trump is a RAAAAAYCIIISS  Typical Liberal cuck saying everyone is racist. Despite the fact Trump condemned David Duke later in the day after he read more up on him. So Trump is a racist for not automatically condemning someone he doesn't know even though he actually did condemn them? hahaa   9: Trump wants to take out ISIS families  So are you defending ISIS family members now? Is a terrorist off limits now because Mrs. Jihad lives with him and takes care of him but she personally doesn't fight in the war. Collateral damage is now a war crime? Was any of this supposed to make me want to vote for criminal Hillary, or blacklivesmatter supporting cuck Bernie?

"I was deep into the ocean on a vessel I hadn't manned before, I am a photographer and I generally just on any ship willing to take me to shoot a few shots of the night sky. As I hadn't been on this ship before it made me nervous, doing this for a while you tend to get to know captains who are okay with taking you for a small price. But nothing gave me a feeling of unease during the day so I just enjoyed the ride and got on with my tasks. As night fell it got very dark very quickly and I couldn't see many stars in the sky, the cold hit really fast as well and I was freezing, the spray from the sea got really intense and my jacket ended up completely soaked which didn't help. I was hoping it would get better, the stars would shine, the sky would change colour, the lighting would improve I'm not sure I was hoping for anything, when I spotted it in the sea, there was a hat floating past which was odd, I quickly took a few snaps of the hat as it drifted past us and finally get pushed away by the waves created.  About 20/25 minutes passed when we saw a flashing red beacon in the distance and a sharp whistle blowing, our ship changed direction and headed over to its aid, as we was nearing the man I took several photographs, he was wearing a life jacket with a red flashing toggle on it and blowing a whistle like mad even as we approached, I will never remember the look on his face, almost like a scared dog, we reached out to help him but he fought us off, almost like he didn't want to be rescued. I told him firmly, ""Come, we can help you, the water is freezing"" He continued to fight us. ""Is there anything we give to help this man?""

"*Facepalm*. You have to be the worst historian in history.   All it takes is a quick look at wikipedia, you don't have to talk out of your ass.    &gt;The party emerged from the German nationalist, racist and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture, which *fought against the communist uprisings* in post-World War I Germany.[6] The party was created as a means to *draw workers away from communism* and into völkisch nationalism.[7] Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities, and in the 1930s the party's focus shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes.  -   &gt;In 1922, a party with remarkably similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the National Fascist Party under the leadership of the charismatic Benito Mussolini. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country; opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the Treaty of Versailles; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. The Italian Fascists used a straight-armed Roman salute and wore black-shirted uniforms. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, borrowing their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute. When the Fascists came to power in 1922 in Italy through their coup attempt called the ""March on Rome"", Hitler began planning his own coup.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party  &gt;Hitler hated socialism and communism and worked to destroy these ideologies. Nazism, confused as it was, was based on race, and fundamentally different from class focused socialism.  http://europeanhistory.about.com/od/germanyandprussia/fl/Was-Adolf-Hitler-a-Socialist-Debunking-a-Historical-Myth.htm  It is so easy to find the right information, why not just look it up?

Think about it.  Maybe you are not a developer like many here.  Just some kid wanting to get some kewl VR!  And all the popular media is drooling over roomscale with input on Portal 2!  Or Sony VR with move Input!  While oculus has luckys tale with a gamepad?  That isn't exciting, that is boring.  What kind of price do you put on all that free advertising, of thousands of magazines, youtubers, word of mouth freaking out on the Vive hype train with roomscale and input?  A lot of people need to remember that is what propelled Palmer, all the free media and marketing hype.  It has now gone to Vive Valve and to a lesser extent to Sony VR.  As any good politician knows, marketing is the entire game, and how much free press you can get and ride the hype train.  I don't see how Oculus is going to get that lead role back from Valve.",-11

"Not really, no. What painters, musicians or writers would you identify with ""white culture?"" The closest I can think of is the rapper Lil' Dicky, but his discussion of his whiteness is more a point of humor to contrast with the dominant black culture of the rap community.

"&gt; Russia has repeatedly denied a military presence in the conflict, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But the Russian president conceded there were military intelligence officers operating in the country in a marathon press conference on Thursday.  Advisers is not the same thing as a ""military presence"". Surely you get that, right? We have all read the fearmongering reports of huge columns of Russian army entering Ukraine. It turns out it was all bullshit by the western presstitutes.   &gt;But a year later, the President came clean. In a documentary aired last weekend, he admitted ordering his troops to seize Crimea weeks before it was annexed into Russia on March 18, 2014.  Western propagandists intentionally confuse two separate issues. There wasn't any doubt that there are Russian soldiers in Crimea, they were allowed to be there by the bilateral agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Their number never exceeded 22,000 as allowed by the agreement. ",-11

Anyone 'nearby' (far enough not to melt, 100 metres or something) would likely die of neutron radiation VERY quickly. Other than expenses and immediate radiation poisoning there are no real dangers, since the helium/hydrogen plasma is only radioactive for a short time. The reaction would instantly turn off due to heat dissipation and so there is no chain reaction that leads to more devastation.

"There are a lot of people who are wrong in this situation. None of them are you.  Firstly, the trainer(s) you talked to are wrong on a number of fronts-- astonishingly so. First of all, there's no reason that an older dog's behavior toward other dogs can't be changed. Small animals that it sees as prey, yes (to an extent-- or at least, I guess I'd say I really wouldn't have that much hope for it); other dogs, no. Secondly, there is no correlation at all between dog aggression and human aggression in dogs, unless you count situations where the ""aggression"" is a reaction to something like a dog being in incredible pain or having another medical issue. If the kids were younger, I could see being concerned about dog-aggressive dogs because a young child might get into the middle of a dog fight without understanding what's happening, but that's not the case for preteens/teens.  So what I'd consider first is finding a better trainer. If that's not in the cards, though, or if it doesn't help-- which unfortunately is completely possible-- then rehoming the aggressive dog is the fairer option by far. Firstly, because that dog was only just adopted; your family hasn't had it for years. Secondly, because it's much easier to find a new home for one dog than to find a new home for two dogs together, and breaking up a pair of dogs that have lived together all their life is really something that's best avoided if possible.",-7

Injuries or no, you won't beat balanced teams with that defense when it matters.   And I think the allegiance to Clay Matthews is a prime factor in keeping it from being fixed. He doesn't meet the expectations that his fame should require. He doesn't take over games. He doesn't make opponents alter their game plan.

"Because we saw what they did with FO4. I mean, it comes down to that. Unless there was some massive shift in development priorities between the development of FO4 and the development of the DLC, we have every reason to expect ""Yes, sarcastic yes, tell me more, no (but actually yes)"" and disconnected vignettes to be the order of the day. That is the most frustrating thing about FO4 to me, not the linearity of the areas or the really insultingly dumb (and extremely limited) main quest or even their disdain for anything resembling clever problem solving, but the fact that they had all of these great pieces that they couldn't put together in any kind of coherent way, even down to something as simple as telling Preston that you liberated Quincy or giving Piper really important information that seems to be her biggest driving interest in the game.

"it was the Americans, who lent some ""french"" (actually mostly spanish french foreign legion) soldiers American equipment. de Gaulle did force the issue through, as the Americans and British were more concerned with trying to win the war than liberating a city that was to be defended to the last. And by force I mean he ordered some forces to do it without consultation with the Americans and UK (those forces being mostly Spanish soldiers and some frenchmen using american equipment). Ike was sick of de Gaulle's shit, which caused an insurrection against the garrison which was trying to leave, and sent some real help to fully liberate the city because they could have been massacred without assistance.   While de Gaulle spread the myth that it was the people of the city, it was the french foreign legion (mostly spanish) and american equipment and logistics (and then troops) that freed the city.  Then de Gaulle because he seemed very concerned about his future political career asked the Americans to have a parade the next day (as he was worried he didn't have their backing, i mean, he did basically steal a bunch of their stuff for an unauthorized mission), which they did... and he didn't invite the Brits.

If it's likely, then it must be done with certainty.  &gt;There might be a revolution there next year for all you know.  And they might plan their own pre-emptive strike by next year.  You're willing to risk millions of lives around the region and your own country? when you can simply risk millions of NK lives instead? They will never rebel when they are this brainwashed. It's a country gone mad.  &gt;Bunker technology is not that complicated.   We have anti-bunker technology and if communications are destroyed and EMPs occur, it's likely they won't be able to launch.  But either way, there is a greater risk that NK will pre-emptively launch. How come you are willing to risk that out of ""hope"" of some future rebellion that hasn't happened for 60 years.  ",-8

Take a step back ok?  This is on him. You are *surprised* he would even think this was ok, a married man and a young single woman. You feel *disrespected* that he would think this was ok.  Then address your own issues -- find time to exercise, value yourself and if you are yelling at the kids, what are you resenting already that you are unable to parent the way you want?  Perhaps your husband is this selfish in other areas of your relationship?  His male friend cancelled right?  CANCEL THE TRIP.

Feeling dumb, but trying to figure out what the best course of action is here. Any advice appreciated. &gt;  &gt; In 2015, I worked several months as a salaried employee. We agreed on a salary of 50K per annum, and I was paid monthly. I didn't receive pay stubs, and I don't remember what the excuse was. The money after taxes direct deposited to my account every month, and I didn't worry about it because I just sort of assumed that taxes would be a big chunk, and I didn't calculate how much. &gt;  &gt; When I was laid off at the end of the month, they told me I would receive two weeks pay as severance. The next month, they deposited a full month's wages in my account. I alerted them, and they said they'd send an invoice, and then they never did. &gt;  &gt; Now, I've just received my W-2, and I discover that I was actually underpaid significantly from what was agreed. Like $5K less. The whole time, they'd been paying me less than I thought we had agreed, and I hadn't noticed. I feel retarded, naturally, because this could have been prevented if I had paid any attention whatsoever. &gt;  &gt; I've also received an invoice for the extra two weeks of pay they deposited. Apparently, they finally got around to doing the books, months after I brought it to their attention. &gt;  &gt; I no longer have access to my company email address, which contained the record of the verbal/conversational agreement to a higher wage than was paid. I don't have access to anything in writing. I am a rube. &gt;  &gt; I feel pretty ill-used, and also stupid. After discovering that I was paid less than agreed, it's sort of insult upon injury to send them a check for $2k. Do I have any options? Any recourse? &gt;  &gt; Or do I just write this off as an expensive learning experience? &gt;  &gt; Thanks y'all.",-6

"Communism.  They had a number on how many people the government could afford based on their numbers.  Too many people,  more drain on resources.  So the solution was to reduce the numbers.  Like owning too many farm animals. If you can only afford to raise 10 chickens,  but have 20, 10 gotta go. In their opinion,  it was for the good of the country and benefit more in the end at the cost of a few.   This is what eventually occurs when you give one entity complete control over everything.  That entity views your work and life as their own property,  and you are the tool.    You won't find it described like this by pro communist tools.  They dress it up,  compare and contrast other communist ideologies,  and won't give you a concise answer to anything.  Communism is giving complete control of everything, to the governing body.  They will dress it up in some altruistic,  semi confusing,  massive paragraph of how great it is,  but here is all you have to realize.  Communism has no definition,  but you can easily judge it by its history.   It will 100% occur again at some point in the future.  Probably not any time soon,  but if people exist for another 1,000 years,  this will cycle through more than a few times. I think it's actually occurring right now in places like North Korea.  ",-7

I had to go, and I didn't even get to order my own food due to being seated in a corner.   3. The lasting problem here is that I don't think its anyone else's decision what I decide to eat.  If I want to be vegan most of the time, I am free to do so.  If I want to eat an animal product occasionally, that is also my decision, and none of anybody else's business.   4.

"2.2% income tax increase, but you will not pay monthly premiums for health insurance.  Under Medicare-for-all, Americans would have comprehensive care, covering doctors' visits, hospital stays, long-term and hospice care, vision, dental, mental health and prescription drugs. They would no longer have to pay private insurance premiums, deductibles or co-pays.  To pay for it, Sanders is calling for a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans and a 6.2% levy on employers. But he would also hike taxes on the wealthy. Sanders' campaign, however, argues that average Americans would save more than $5,000 by scrapping their monthly premiums.   Sanders' plan relies on $6.3 trillion (over 10 years) in savings, much of it coming from lowering the rates paid to doctors, hospitals, home health care providers and drug manufacturers.   Sanders would raise the minimum wage, as well as shift income from the rich to the middle and working class through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations.  Sanders' plan to pour $14.5 trillion into the economy -- including spending on infrastructure and youth employment, increasing Social Security benefits, making college free and expanding health care and family leave -- would juice GDP and productivity.   Free college doesn't mean universities can charge the government the astronomical fees they are charging students. Just as public K12 schools can't charge whatever they please for each student.  Sanders' plan would be more stimulative because it is pouring money into the economy, as opposed to cutting taxes.

"&gt; The crux of the issue is that he deleted the video just after the monetisation shifted from him to Grade. That's either a massive coincidence, or it was done intentionally as he knew he wasn't getting paid anymore.  Or he realized grade didn't want the video up (which Grade could have mentioned to him in an email or something, but didn't) and took it down because of that. Tyrone said he took it down when someone told him Grade told him he didn't want it up, I imagine Grade never told anyone he didn't want it up until he noticed the video and filed the claim.   Grade could have at least tried talking to him, filing a claim on an old reaction video is just stupid. Tyrone makes like 4 videos a day, once they are 4 months old no one is going to see it anymore.

"My personal opinion as a gun owner is that the judges have mostly gotten it right.  We're allowed to have guns, as American citizens.  But, certain restrictions can apply.   If you want to carry a gun in a city, this is not a traditional right that people have just automatically had.  So, it's reasonable to require a permit to do so.  But, opinions are all over the place.  Many gun owners simply assume that the second amendment means no restrictions can apply, but this has never been historically true.  And, no court has ever ruled that this is the case.  Even pro-gun judges agree that gun rights can be somewhat restricted without violating the second amendment.  ",-8

I can shoot in about every which way there is.  I have always been top player everywhere I have played and also an avid fan.

If someone shoots upper 90 it is meaningless to me unless it is clear they had control.  If this guy had the control to shoot with the side of his toe from 20 yards out into the upper 90 then he must be the greatest shooter that ever was.  Every great player has to use more traditional technique and still they only can do this once in a while.

"&gt; Looks like one of the pacific islands where the Japanese fought to the death  The japanese fought to the death because they had no choice. The US/Australia/Britain had a racist 'no prisoner' policy against the japanese.   That's why if you look at the battle records of the pacific war, you will see no wounded and no POWs for the japanese. The japanese were systematically murdered, torture and mutilated.   Some say it was the most brutal and the most depraved theatre of ww2. The japanese were viewed as asian subhumans ( practically animals ) and treated as such. The myth about the ""brave"" and ""unsurrendering"" japanese were nonsense we invented many years after ww2 when historians and journalists started asking about the bizarre casualty stats in the pacific theatre. We ""saved face"" by saying that the japanese fought to the death, but in reality we simply had a no prisoner policy and just murdered them all.  There is war footage of allied troops torturing wounded japanese soldiers. And there are tons of mutilation pictures of japanese soldiers.  It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of japanese soldiers were tortured and mutilated. The eastern front is where the brutality of ww2 was. The pacific theatre was where the absolute brutality was. ",-15

"First, your future in-laws are being petty. I think Lilblacksheepsie has the best advice on this point.  That being said, I have some advice about the dog:  &gt;The options, then, are to take the dog to his parents' house with us, or stay in a hotel, or they visit us.  Or you could simply board the dog when/if you need to travel in the future. I know you don't want to leave the dog alone at night (especially when young), but this may be your best option. It's relatively cheap, your dog isn't pushed on friends or family for days at a time, it allows your dog to be socialized with both people and other animals, and your dog will be in excellent care.   When I need to take a trip that is 8+ hours (which at the moment is at least twice a month due to a parent's health issues), I'll have my dog stay at my vet. They offer cheap boarding (around $25/night), and they love my dog to death! They often have her sit behind the front desk with the vet-techs. My dog never, ever whines about going to the vet and loves everyone there.   See if your vet, or if other vets in your area, offer this service. Ask about costs, feeding times, and activities (for example, my vet offers 30 minutes of solo play time for an extra charge, which I do for extended trips). This will allow you to travel while your dog is in the best care available. Even if an emergency happens, your dog is already where it needs to be.  Edit: clarification",-7

"I do not know whether his actions legally count as sexual assault. I think they do, because she always started out not wanting it, she feared for her reputation, and it traumatized her, as well as the specific instance in the parking lot. I also think the case of it being sexual assault would be stronger in court if I'm correct that he follows a pattern and does the exact same thing to other girls, causing similar psychological damage.   If what he did doesn't legally count as rape, or it can't be proven in court, that doesn't change the fact that many, many people, including many women he could target, definitely count what he did as rape. As I said, I'd ideally want him convicted and registered as a sex offender, but I know that's a long shot. I'd be satisfied with it simply being known what he actually did, instead of people thinking either me or the girl are simply making it up, so that it can be part of his reputation and any girl meeting him has a chance to consider it and maybe prevent herself from being manipulated. I figured if he took me to court for slander, there was a high chance that the truth would come out, but he wouldn't be charged, and it would simply divide those that know of him between those that consider his actions rape and those that don't. I figured that would at least be enough to make a big difference to his ability to hurt people, so if it's the best I can do... point is, the legal definition isn't all that matters. The outcome of the case can impact lives in other ways.  One thing I'd like to say as an aside, it's kind of relevant... I might be amicable to the court ordering me to stop calling it rape, and not state it as absolute fact, but still allowing me to tell people what I have heard and how I heard it - which is what I've been doing anyway, not lying about anything, but telling people the story. She called it rape, and I'm inclined to agree because I see a pattern. But honestly, a word doesn't matter, the reality of what happened and how dangerous he is does. ",-17

When people colloquially and casually refer to something as something it isn't, then the term evolves to include the new definition as well  Not when it completely changes the entire foundation of an ideology.

It's not so much that im being pedantic to be a dick, but calling Bernie Sanders a socialist is just fundamentally incorrect.

"&gt; I had an emotional and deep reaction to RDR. The same way people get emotional reactions to literature, movies, paintings, etc.   Doesn't matter. People have emotional reactions to football games- doesn't make them art.  &gt;  ""Playing"" a game is the same as looking at a painting, reading a book, or watching a movie.  No it isn't, and I explained why. Different mindset. It's about winning the game. You can't lose the game or you won't get the experience. You can't ""lose"" or ""die"" at a play or a song, it simply communicates the experience to you. The competition that drives the gameplay completely subverts the role of art, as I said- so again, even if you think games are art, they're by far the worst art since they actively put a roadblock between the audience and the ideas that want to express.  &gt; Just because your idea of what is art is different from someone else's does not make it invalid.

"&gt;Where I think she was right: - She communicated up front that we're just friends months ago  &gt;Where I think she went wrong: - Her behavior (always being the one to initiate sleeping, cuddling, etc.) changed and contradicted what she was saying about being friends - Her communication became more and more vague ('touching is ok, just not now' etc.) as things progressed  I think you might view Male-Female friendships different then Male-Male or Female-Female, and that's where the communication issue is from.  &gt;She makes it clear that 'we are just friends.'  Friends can sleep in the same bed together.  It's called a sleepover.  They often cuddle or hug or dance together.  They have intimate conversations, because the other person is a friend that they connect with and trust. It doesn't always lead to sex, because friendship isn't about sex; friendship is quite literally about an intimate connection with another person that is not sexual in nature.  &gt;I move downwards, at which point she tells me to stop, she moves away, and I tell her, ""If I can't touch you like that, I don't know what I'm supposed to do."" She says, ""I don't mind being touched, I just don't want to do it right now."" Ok...so next time...?  This was partially her fault.  She should have made it clear that by ""right now"" she meant in a romantic way with you.  You had made your romantic feelings clear, and she was trying to cut them off.  However, she might have just felt on the spot and was trying to put off/avoid another conversation that she found to be awkward.   &gt;Where I think we both went wrong: - We didn't set very concrete boundaries  Boundrys were set, they just had different meanings for the two of you.   &gt;She asks if I (a) like her as a person to share ideas and company with or (b) if it's sexual. It's definitely a love as a person. But if asked, I would say 'yes' to sex with someone like her. So I say 'yes' to all of the above.  You thought that the boundarys were that if you continued to be close with her, that would mean sex/dating.  I suspect that she thought that after she made it clear that you were just friends that you two could have the cuddling-type interactions and you would know that it wouldn't lead anywhere, which was the point of her confronting you with those questions.   Neither of you are ""wrong"" for how you feel, but she assumed that after that first conversation you would be fine with being friends, including physical touching in a non-sexual way, and you assumed that her being intimate with her friendship and cuddling with you meant that she changed her mind about a relationship.    &gt;Is it crazy for me to think that she did a bad job communicating?  No.  But you also didn't do a good job of communicating.  If you can't handle being friends with her *and* the cuddling/dancing/sharing a bed, then you need to tell her.  And you can and should ask her to be forthright and honest about how she views you, and that she can't flirt or avoid questions about ""being touched"" and where if you are to be friends.   Edit: OP, can you clarify if by sleeping together you mean actually *sleeping* in the same bed (which is how I interpreted it,) or did you have sex? This makes a big difference in the advice I would give you. ",-12

"Rugby players are way smaller than football players, and don't hit nearly as hard because they aren't wearing pads.  Don't get it twisted, the pads are there to protect the guy doing the hitting, not the other way around.  Wearing helmets and shoulder pads gives you the ability to hit somebody at full speed in the chest/stomach (where the opponent is not wearing any pads).  If you don't wear pads, you can't deliver that type of hit without breaking your own shoulder.",-8

"You shouldn't be to hard to him. I know he has hurt you and it has also broken the trust for each other. He really messed up in that thing. But you should still think about two important things right now:  1. You are pregnant with a child you both decided to have. This kid has a right to have a father and a mother. Think about your child. No man ever can fill that daddy position, like the real dad. And to grow up with a stepdad that doesn't really care as much or even growing up without a dad, is very hard for kids. It breaks their souls and hearts. And even if you get to share your kid over weekends or so, your kid will always miss the love from parents, which love each other and him/her too.   2. also to add, your pregnant right now, you have dozens of hormones rushing through your blood. It often leads to women, who seem to have lost love for their husbands or are very easy to hurt and stuff. Chances are high, you are not able to make reasonable decisions right now, because of that. I know it's hard to understand when you're right in it, but you should definitely wait till the birth of your kid, before making a final decision.   So I think you should consider it a bit more rationally. Imagine yourself in his position: you would invite a girlfriend to your house, your husband stays at home, while you are working and some other friend tells you, he has seen your husband cheating. Wouldn't that hurt you too and make you furious at first? And I've never seen a cheater, who just admitted, yeah, you're right I'm cheating on you. Every cheater tries to lie only to get away with it. So basically your husband was also out of control and I'm pretty sure he had a hard time thinking rationally and getting his thoughts together. When someone tells your your partner is cheating it's like a red flag and it feels like your loosing ground under your feet. You should try to put yourself in his position, you would also be hurt at first and try to find evidence to proof yourself wrong. So basically, you both are victims of very bad circumstances. I think you should take your time now: give him a chance to proof you he's truly sorry for what he did. Let him take you out, buy you flowers and presents etc. your love can grow when you go together through this struggle and his trust in you will be now much stronger. In my sight, I would say, you both have a future together. I mean, if he wouldn't love you, he wouldn't care, if you cheat on him. He wouldn't go furious about it. And you wouldn't have married him or decided to have a child with him, if you wouldn't love him. And since there was no actual cheating, you both have the great option to find back to each other and become a much stronger couple. ",-41

"&gt; You realize a movie can be improved for multiple reasons, right? More gay/black/women characters is an improvement just in that it adds more representation for people who are historically underrepresented.  In a socially progressive context.  I totally get it and I'm favor of it.  BUT... If you tell me you're going to make a movie based on Asimov's books (please don't) making specific characters black/asian/hispanic/gay/&lt;insert other US minority&gt; won't really affect my judgement (I didn't use women as an example because Asimov's books have pretty strong female characters).  &gt; How those characters perform or how they're written is another matter, but the weight of evidence shouldn't fall on them to ""prove"" their worth based on their race/sexuality/gender.  I agree.  They shouldn't have to be praised beforehand or add some points to the movie just because they exist either.  From a movie quality perspective not from a social one.  &gt; Straight white men have played a lot of really bad characters in movies, nay, in the Star Wars movies no less. And yet, their race/sexuality/gender never enter the equation; no one assumes Christian Haydenson was cast to appeal to angsty young white guys. He's just ""normal"" casting choice.  Sure.  I haven't argued against it and I'll be the first to criticize bad movies.  I disliked Harry Potter movies and like Lord of the ring movies.  I didn't like them more or less because the characters were white men or women... I judged them on their merits.  Same should go for the SWs world.

"MBDTF is easily the best album in Modern Hip Hop. There's almost no arguing. It has some of the most interesting, unique and classic beats, some of the best lines from the best rappers from all of the world and has incredible instrumentation, while being incredibly well produced and mastered.  This is coming from someone who doesn't give a shit about Kanye, Yeezus was alright in my opinion, I'd give it a 7/10. But I haven't even bothered listening to TLOP all the way through, it's been poorly mastered, isn't really all that interesting and is kind of trying too hard in most areas.  Kanye's career was a Crescendo that climaxed at MBDTF. Everything on the way to that album was great, some hiccups, but each album was good in its own way - and they were all different. Yeezus in my opinion was probably the last 'good' album Kanye will make, unless he decides to work with different people and adhere to a different vision in the future musically.  People get hard over Kanye because when MBDTF came out everyone jumped on the bandwagon (rightfully so), and defended his actions because he did orchestrate an absolutely incredible album that will stand out as a timeless figure in hip hop. However, the people that latch onto someone no matter the crap they release afterwards - Kanye has yet to release full-on 'crap', but other ventures like Watch The Throne and self-releases such as Yeezus and definitely TLOP were IMO underwhelming -  will stop as soon as the next MASSIVE genre-defining album in hip hop is dropped, and the internet/media go crazy over it those people that religiously defend Kanye will jump onto that next bandwagon.  People are scared to be branded an 'idiot' or are scared to have differing opinions to the majority of others in a social circle/subreddit/forum and will generally latch onto others beliefs to fit in - This is no new news, and is the same within musical trends.   You also need to understand that this is all my opinion, and I understand others might think differently. But I believe i'm speaking from a pretty neutral field opinion wise as I don't really care so much for personalities within Hip Hop, and would rather judge an artist for their music as opposed to how they act on twitter.  Downvoted because I successfully labeled every Kanye fanboy into thinking twice about whether TLOP was good or not? Sorry kids. ",-7

"Alright. its time to step in I think. people here are way too on the bandwagon dickfucking plane ride and I feel something is a little out of line.   Lemme start off with myself - im a nobody. nobody knows me, I'm friends with nobody and im not actively part of any cumguggling groupies. I'm not taking anyones side here, its simply my own opinion.   I'm a believer of the ""innocent until proven guilty"" philosophy, I think, to a certain degree that its incorrect to accuse someone of any sort of actions until there is proof! Here, Accurian is clearly denying any sort of accusations, saying its a bug and what not - stuff I don't really care about, but I think people aren't taking anything from his perspective. I'm trying to think here...think long and carefully...its what I do.  My first point im going to make is the general bandwagoning effect. I KNOWWWWWW okay, I KNOWWW its soo easy to think that he could've/would've exploited such a bug. I know its so easy to think that maybe he was just curious and he let that curiosity and some sort of sensation take over him - ""maybe one slightly cheated score wont hurt"" or 10?.., I mean who would notice out of 1000, right? its so easy to think that and im going to be honest here: I believed evb was entirely legitimate until ... hat...a... yeah proved him a few weeks ago.   but no  I think thats not what he was thinking. Accurian is smarter than that. He knows guilt, I can see it in his words. It's silly to assume what he was doing was malicious (intentionally). Look, I want to believe what Accurian is saying is the truth and by all means do I agree that not reporting it was his fault I can understand though - by all definition he's not cheating and if its ""random"" and the outcome is freelo... why not! okay lets be fucking real human beings here. the ""ideal"" thing to do is immediately report it, right? thats entirely correct but its stupid. I hate you and your social norms and façade of lies. I'm basically saying that it's not Accurian's fault (if be true, which I think it is) so he can't be blamed for any of it. in hindsight, he should have reported it...obviously.   okay lets put it like this. You encounter a bug in League of Legends and it makes you use ur Q on 100% CD. I mean at least 8/10 times people are gonna exploit the living shit out of this...cmon, I've literally seen it 20+ times on bug reports/videos and some guy is like ""wow ur a massive dick exploiting that"" but man I think he was just doing it cause he can.   Punishment is necessary to keep order but I don't wanna but blame on Accurian for 1. Being human (my thought, im so sorry if you didn't want freelo.gg - to an extent...ya guys know what I mean, right?) 2. being a victim of a bug and I hate to see people literally roast the everliving shit out of this guy without giving him room to breathe. Now he's being called the cheater, the liar, the dickface whatever it be. It's wrong. definitely more investigation needs to be done and if be it I think Accurian if he missed anything at all should come out clean. it's too easy to miss out words on text and he still has chances.   tl;dr Chill out you crazy dog, it was just a prank. Look camera is right over there! Accurian legit until guilty and I believe his words. ""nothing to fear or worry as I did not cheat"" is something i'd also say if I didn't *cheat* but playing unfair w/ knowledge is something everyone can relate. ppl needa chill and take off that internet police badge.   just my thought - I had spare time. I won't reply to most unless I deem necessary or valid points are raised in my argument.   and soz for shitty english, im kinda retarded. ",-13

"It's misogynistic to keep quiet and not speak out against an alleged rape that may or may not have happened? At the moment this is nothing more than a case of he said/she said because Kesha hasn't provided any evidence to support her allegations, which means the accused must reasonably be given the benefit of the doubt because we live in a society where one is rightfully innocent until proven guilty. I wonder how Bob would react if I accused him of rape right now? I have no proof but if he believes that a testimony from the victim is all that is necessary then I guess we should consider him a guilty rapist if we're going by his logic.   Sony has invested $60M into Kesha's career so a multi-album contract is not going to be nullified based on allegations, that Kesha refuses to support with sufficient evidence. Sony have offered her the chance to work without Dr Luke and the already stated fact that they've invested around $60M into her career, shows that they're most likely not going to lessen the endorsement of one of the biggest pop stars (and cash cows) in the world.   This #FreeKesha movement is extremely unfair and unjust towards Sony and Dr Luke from a purely objective point of view at this point in time. This is why the concept of innocent until proven guilty is important. It protects possibly innocent men from being smeared and branded as a criminals. I don't know if Dr Luke is innocent or guilty. Neither does Bob or anyone else not directly involved. But it's unfair to label him as guilty without any real evidence.   My excitement for Bob has died down a lot since he started posting his opinions on social issues. Not only does it alienate fans who hold different beliefs to him (I'm not routing for someone who wrongly generalizes me as a misogynistic oppressor) but it's incredibly irresponsible. He has a fanbase now. He needs to realize that it's not responsible for him to give misguided views on something he clearly doesn't know about. It can spread ignorance among his followers. ",-16

If you look back at our history, God has blessed this country *because* we have been faithful to His word, even if we make mistakes sometimes.

They always have some idea of how well their product will sell (with a reasonable margin of error of course), but they can compare apples to apples.

If Ambrose wins, though, even though I'd also want him to win the title from HHH at mania I think that its enough presence from Roman to turn heel and try to interfere in the main event, maybe prevented by a still-injured Seth Rollins, who wants to get back at HHH. That could start a year-long build to a shield triple threat at wrestlemania 33.

"I appreciate your informative response, my intention was never to deceive or misinform, so I will edit my comment to unlink that article.  The problem is it seems most authors and published studies are all coming at it from anti-fluoridation or pro-fluoridation and it's literally impossible to find a truly unbiased article that chooses a satisfactory sample and bases their conclusions on the raw data.  The real problem lies in the fact that it's difficult to statistically argue the cause any particular level of fluoridation has on tooth decay because there is no way to control the actual dosage that any individual receives.  A few years ago I remember a report mentioning tooth decay rates in Quebec (where the water is not fluoridated) to Ontario (where most municipalities fluoridate) and there was minimal effect shown with slight indication that all else being the same fluoridated water resulted in 1/2 a cavity per child, stats Canada was unwilling to make any conclusive statements.  As always, the anti-fluoridation crowd is basing their opinion based on health, and it seems there is irrefutable evidence that at higher dosages fluoride absolutely can have negative health consequences, and my biggest beef about the public policy of fluoridating the water supply is that they are in effect mass medicating the population without a prescription or consent and with no good way to control the dosage delivered.",-6

"Why is that the way it's supposed to be pronounced when you can point to absolutely no rule in the English language as to why it should be pronounced like that? There's a name for the phenomenon but it's basically just people getting lazy with the pronunciation over time and it becoming colloquially popular to pronounce it like that and eventually it becomes ""official"".  That's why you can't bitch about foreigners mispronouncing the word, because nobody looks at that word for the first time having no knowledge of the proper pronunciation and pronounces it properly. Again, it is not intuitive. Neither is the pronunciation of Leicester. Maybe that's difficult for you to understand because you live in the UK, but it's stupid to laugh at people for mispronouncing a word that makes absolutely no sense. It's like them not knowing how to navigate the underground or where to get good food in London: laughing at them for not knowing is stupid.  e: and if the town had an English-derived name and was in America it would probably be pronounced phonetically and wouldn't be terribly difficult for foreigners in the first place.",-7

"&gt; Feminist theory is not SJW inherently. It's the people on Tumblr that has given you that opinion of it.

There's nothing racist in pointing out that different groups of people have different reactions to thing. When you use the reaction of some people not in the target audience, in order to analyze what the intent of the creators were, you're gonna make a faulty analysis. When Digibro says that Kirin was made the way she was so that people can feel attracted towards her sexually ""under the assurance that she's totally an adult who's making her own decision"", he is drawing in the perspective of a certain type of audience that is quite simply irrelevent when trying to analyze the intent of the creators.  You actually see this quite a bit in the western anime community. Like the fans of Kill la Kill (and many other anime for that matter) who belive that the fanservice in the show is designed to mock fanservice, and that the creator really doesn't like fanservice at all.

Even the famed ""Tet Offensive"" which was the biggest action by the Viet Cong failed, going to show that America was not defeated on the field. Pulling out was a political realization that the US has no business being involved in foreign civil wars, which sadly has continued.   Further, if the war was an ideological one - which is the only way of rationalizing the importance of Vietnam - then America won since communism is virtually dead. ",-22

"This article is token to the kind of irrational thinking that's been happening in America lately. It's this novel idea of an Utopian society where we all play by the rules &amp; everybody wins. It'd be nice if such was life, but like utopia these things only exist in fantasy.   The reality is that business is driven by profit. Without the latter there is no former. We don't operate or stay in operation because it feels nice or it's good for society. If that was our mission we'd dawn the moniker of ""non-profit"" and exploit the taxless structure of that government loophole all the same. We are in business to make money.   Whether we like it or not, Friedman was right. ""People have no interest other than greed, and that greed will somehow lead to a greater good."" Society now, then &amp; eons ago always contained the same simple construct: Limited resources worth fighting over &amp; given to those who wanted them the most. It wasn't to be dived up among everyone.Maybe I'm remembering this wrong but I'm pretty sure the saying wasn't ""to the victor goes the spoils and to the loser the other spoils"". You might not want to believe that the kings of Spain were driven by greed when they paid Columbus to go on his voyage, and you might really believe they were looking to map the world for humanities sake, but I'm sorry friend you're on your own there.  Greed is what made America rise to the top. With endless incentive (Capitalism) we were able to produce the greediest of all people &amp; those people, with endless opportunity, were able to produce the defining characteristics of our society. From our steel &amp; railroads to our technological revolution, Americans are a product of those that were hungry. They weren't looking for a meal from the man who was working for humanities interest, they were starving for success that only comes with the greedy desire of doing anything &amp; everything to be the best.  Remove that incentive from the equation and you're just fooling your mind into believing in something that humanity has rejected. There is no harmoniousness among us humans and especially not on a scale of a countries population. Sure you might know of a few friends living on a commune and they swear they're all in it together, but apply that theory among a society of more than 1000 people and I bet a handful will quickly show you why humanity, greed &amp; selfishness are synonyms.   We would like to change this reality, but like a leopard can't hide its spots, us humans can't hide our genetic makeup. No matter how much of the gospel we listen to, or how much we convince ourselves to treat others like we want to be treated, when there's one seat left on the plane that we've been waiting for in the airport the past two days .. guess what... we're fighting the 9 other people who were waiting for it with us. It's human nature.  Friedman and Raynd both understood this dichotomy between humanity &amp; progress because they were privy to being a part of a sect that experienced it in its most ruthless form;They were Jews. When one witnesses the attempt at exterminating ones race, they understand that humanity no longer possess the composition of harmony let alone Utopia. Humanity possesses greed &amp; ruthlessness and the more you try to appease it, the further back you'll be in line. The more you seize it, the more food will be on your plate.  The new millennium has brought a global economic construct  that has birthed the hungry on every shore. The threats to American greatness are real &amp; to suggest thwarting the desire to be great as possible, is to assume that the rest of the world is throwing their greedy people in cauldrons. They aren't. Those greedy people are leading the sectors as we sit by diddling our thumbs and complaining about not getting our fair share. My goodness we have even evolved to the illusion that our rights are being infringed upon. Rights? Rights! The only right you've been granted is air my friend, everything else is a product of someone else's greed, that you should be thankful for.  As Friedman said ""that greed will somehow lead to a greater good."" and it has. We've evolved to having virtually no need to impact our existence. From food &amp; water being accessed at any turn, to heat &amp;  air conditioning provided as givens, we the modern humans are the epitome of greed's success. From Thomas Edison's days of exploiting inventors to Bill Gates thwarting Microsoft's biggest competitors, greed has brought us what it is we so cherish today. Remove that greed &amp; we reside ourselves to the life of those living in harmonious societies today. North Korea isn't my cup of tea... but I guess you're happy that at least they aren't paying taxes on it. Rights? Rights! Rigggghhhhhhttttt.",-9

"Are you referring to the ""israel should be wiped off the map"" quote? Because that was a mistranslation. 'wiped off the map' is not a Persian idiom, it's an english idiom. He said roughly 'vanish from the pages of time' which is stating how insignificant Israel is, that it will be forgotten about in the future. They don't even recognise it as Israel, they just call it 'this zionist entity'. It was translated by hardliners to 'wipe off the map' to make it more provocative, but Ahmedinejad was not genocidal no matter what you thought of him.  Khomeini issued a fatwa and the hardliners (10-15% of the country's population) reimposed it. They represent maybe half of the Iranian government and are what Iranians are trying to get out. These are the real hardliners, they don't even like Ahmedinehjad.   It's not about sock puppets, it's that you people are so simple that you can't understand (or don't want to see) how complicated things are. Even within the theocracy there are good elements and bad elements.

"It is unfortunate that these students have faced such harsh consequences, despite not having been criminally proven to have committed a sexual assault, but it seems they simply disagree with the standard for expulsion that the University of Texas uses. As the last line of the article indicates, the standard for expulsion isn't a criminal conviction, but any breach of their student conduct policy. Paraphrasing the policy, it seems it only requires a complaint of sexual assault or harassment to be filed with the school to cause a breach. It goes on to state that the standard they rely on is a ""preponderance of the evidence""; Essentially, that standard says that the events more likely occurred than not.  It seems the students had the opportunity to appeal the decision, but I don't see how a ""scapegoat"" argument will help them in a civil case. That's as much to say that the highway patrol is using any one individual as a scapegoat, simply because they didn't give tickets to every (or even most) speeding motorists.  Is there enough evidence to convict these students of a crime? No. Is there enough evidence to show a likely breach of the student code of conduct? Yes. It's a heavy-handed sanction, and the lawsuit offers no clear evidence that would eliminate the likelihood of the breach of the student code. Just like OJ Simpson being acquitted of murder but liable for the deaths of his ex-wife and her partner, escaping conviction does not eliminate all consequence or liability for your actions.

If this cliche were true, we wouldn't need managers, we'd just manage ourselves using computers. It is the job of management to manage that which can not be measured.

Instead any criticism was shouted down by the cheerleaders and all the writers saw was the praise.

"02/08/2016  Ordered: 01/11/2016.  Received: In the same amount of time it takes to order something by boat from China. Rating 4/5 stars   Purchased an 80% lower kit with jig, no mill or dill bits included. Shipping took quite some time but when I called to check they confirmed that they are very behind on orders. Everyone was very nice and easy to deal with in my short conversation with them.   I eventually received my order and everything was correct. It was well packed in a USPS priority mail box. Pricing was spectacular!  I've built a couple polymer lowers in the past so this is my first metal job. Jig and 80% lower look are decent. The jig isn't the highest in quality but looks like like it'll do the job just fine. The jig was never prepped or cleaned or finished. Just looks like it has the necessary holes milled out in the proper locations and then sent out to the customer. A couple of bushings were used on one side of the jig but not the other. I'm not sure if that's a a fix or they forgot to do both sides...either way I'm not sure and is a non issue for me. There are pins on the side panels of the jig that line up with the take-down pins perfectly.   I haven't milled it out yet but everything seems to line up well and looks like it'll be fine once I'm done.   If you are trying to do a budget build and don't really care about aesthetics too much then I would at this point recommend this kit. If you want something that looks fancy then definitely look elsewhere  Again easily a 4 star purchase for me. Maybe different once I mill out this lower.  Great value for the price that I paid!

"I agree that she shouldn't have said women would follow Bernie Sanders because that's where the boys are going.   But I think it's fair for people to ask: when there are two candidates who agree on almost every issue, but one is a woman, why don't young women seem to care about that as much as older women? I think it's fair to ask if they just don't care whether or not a woman gets elected to the Presidency. I would be interested in studies on the subject. When Obama first ran for President, I heard he didn't have a lot of black voter support. Some people hypothesized that black voters just didn't see him as a candidate who stood a chance, until after Iowa voted for him and he started winning more caucuses. So, I think it's fair to ask, could that be what's going on here? Why are people *so angry* at discussing the subject of a candidate's sex?   I mean, over on /r/atheism, people are excited about a non-Christian running. They have a lot of posts supporting Bernie Sanders.   So, we can discuss the importance of a candidate's race &amp; religion, but we can't discuss the importance of a candidate's sex? ",-7

"They're both wars in which Clinton has a role in deciding how the US would respond and what roll it would play. If Clinton becomes president, she plans on pushing Assad out of power as soon as possible, which will simultaneously create a power vacuum for the various factions on the ground to fill, extending the civil war there. She's also going to piss off Putin, whose had a working relationship with the Assad regime since Assad came to power and who has explicitly said he will not allow Assad to be removed. So now, not only will Clinton be expanding a civil war, she will also be antagonizing another hegemonic world super power in the process. Russia will back rebels. United States will back rebels. Now we're fighting a proxy war in Syria and further destabilizing a region and adding more refugees into neighboring countries, which causes tension with those countries leaders.

Most collision events on a motorcycle, even those at low speed, can result in severe injury, permanent disability, or death. About the only thing they are, is FUN, but at a high price to the rider and those around them.  The sad thing is, most motorcyclists have had many close calls it would seem, and have ignored them, dismissing them at the driving ability of others. Regardless if they're in the right, or wrong, eventually they will have a collision, I only hope that they survive and that friends, and family will be available to act as a support structure as they recuperate and try to rebuild their life.

A further note on this is that naturally occuring fluoride isn't added to the water, it is actually Hexafluorosilicic acid which is a byproduct of heavy industry that used to have to be disposed of properly, but now can be sold to local municipalities and added to the water.

We can say all sorts of provocative shit about SJWs/Feminists and cry free speech and censorship when they get offended. &gt; But heaven forbid people start saying things about what they believe in. That's why these concern trolls are worried about expanding past ethics in games journalism. They're afraid their ideology is going to become the new target of GG.  GG used to criticize extremists. Extremists amongst feminists, extremists amongst leftists, extremists amongst progressives, extremists amongst any group. You know why? Because GG was made up of people from every group, every political affiliation, from Tumblr to Reddit to 4chan. We did not attack eachother, we attacked the extremists. But now, even CHSommers gets labelled an SJW. You no longer have to be an extremist to be targeted or called an SJW. All you have to do is espouse some left-wing or progressive values, and you will be lumped in with extremists. I had people call me SRS because I said there is nothing wrong with feminism and that a lot of GG supporters are feminists, that the issue are extremists amongst a group, and that we should not generalize.  I'm just surprised people are getting this pissy about others calling out how GG is slowly moving away from just targeting extremists on either side, to being used as a battering ram against anything that is leftist, or progressive, or feminist. This sub gets outraged when some SJW says shitty stuff about white people, but more and more it comes together to celebrate saying shitty things about non-whites, unless they comply with the circlejerk.

"Just based on what You've said, I'm skeptical that she would feel the same way. This is hard to explain, but basically, trying to ""friend"" your way into a woman being attracted to you rarely works, unless you have 10x more social status than her and several other girls trying to get with you at the same time. Otherwise it's a massive violation of ""Girl code"" for her to date her social support structure. This is unfortunately what you're trying to make yourself into, part pf her support structure.   Also it's not always the best idea to try to date roommates for reasons which aren't to hard to figure out.  That said, Carpe Diem, etc.  Ultimately, do you value a friendship more, or a relationship more?   There's nothing wrong with communication, but talking isn't a substitute for **action.**!!!!!   You: ""hey, I'm going out to bar ABC tomorrow, why don't you come join me?""   If asking her on a date or two makes things awkward, you can deal with it in the long run. If you ask her to hang out and she doesn't show signs of being interested, (Note: if she's interested at all she would have shown before now,) then here's what you do. Shrug it off, and act like nothing happened, stay casual. Meanwhile approach and date other women.  Also, don't call it a ""date"" if she asks. Smile and playfully dodge the question ""what makes you say that?"" then change the subject.  ",-13

"I'm terribly sorry. That sounds hard.   It seems as though your husband didn't just lose his wife. Your sisters-in-law lost a friend. They might have felt closer to her than they do to you. This could be due to personality differences, or just because they're still grieving too much to accept you into their lives the way their brother has accepted you into his.  Grief makes people feel things that don't make sense. Some act on those feelings because they don't know how to deal. It's possible that knowing that will help you cope until they come around. They likely will come around, especially if you continue being your kind, gracious self.   I don't think that you are being too sensitive, and I do think that they are acting like a couple of crazies. Still, I think this is something that might only get worse if you confront them, and might only get better if you bite your tongue for a while longer.  However, if you're at the end of your rope, you might be better off asking your husband to have a frank conversation with them. Better to try to end their passive-aggressive behavior before you find it impossible to keep from exploding! If you say things you don't mean, it'll be that much harder to get your relationship back on track.  Tell your husband to convey, as sensitively as possible, that his sisters' behavior is hurting your feelings. He should make it clear that they're entitled to their grief and all the weirdness that stems from it. Still, their current strategy is causing you to feel alienated and vilified. Your husband should make it plain that he's *sure* they're not doing that on purpose--ahem--but that it's important to him that you feel accepted as his new partner.",-12

"What does it prove? Question was not about slogans of Pakistan zindabad. It was about ""bharat ki barbadi"" and ""100 tukde"" and people in JNU during interview on times now never discarded this possibility that there were no slogans like this. They said 'clearly' that there were slogans but they don't know who were those people, they came out from outside. And they were defending their exercise of this event. Now how come that there were no sloganeering at all. And that JNU student during interview never mentioned this fact that this is a case of fake video, right away. Like they must have been know na if times now/zee news was playing a fake video. Let's believe for a second that zee news actually played a fake video and that there were no Pakistan zindabad in that video then what about 'bharat ki barbadi' and '100 tukde'. And another confusion is Why these students did not discarded that Pakistan zindabad video right away in studio. See question is not about whether the video have Pakistan zindabad slogans or not, question is whether Pakistan zindabad actually happened over there or not. Honestly its a normal practice for TV channels to fine tune raw video footages because obviously there must be a lot of noise in the video and you have to process the video in order to make it 'viewable'. And another thing which is interesting here is that the guy must be in touch of the reporter who was present at JNU during event. And he is by any means not suggesting that ""there were no sloganeering at all"". So why does it matter that if there was actually Pakistan zindabad sloganeering in JNU and it could not be captured in video properly so a news channel actually edited the video and made Pakistan zindabad slogans 'audible' . what does it change? And another thing is why should I have to believe on this chutiya that he is not lying balantly since almost every chutiya in media is hiding some thing or another. Both ZEE news and NDTV are same to me. ",-26

"I wasn't saying it wasn't bad because there are worse things on the Internet. That's not what I said at all. I said that if someone is going to be offended by it, they're in for a really rough time, because there is a fucking *ton* of it online. They're going to be traumatized at every twist and turn, because it's on literally every platform of social media. It's on the Canadiens Twitter, for fuck sakes. That's not to say it isn't bad. It is. It's fucking terrible. But like it or not, it's pretty damn ubiquitous on the Internet.  I wasn't belittling anyone's reactions. By the statement I responded to, someone would be deeply offended by the use of the word nigger. If they're feeling alienated because a word was used, I would put that under the category of ""deeply offended."" Any condescension or patronizing tone there was unintentional - I literally mean that they would be deeply offended.  I'll concede that hockey, generally speaking, has a pretty inclusive subculture. The ""old boys club"" kind of thinking. I personally don't think a person using a racial slur on the Internet perpetuates that. I'm viewing it as an issue with online media, whereas you're viewing it as an issue with hockey fandom. It was on a hockey Twitter account, so I'll meet you half way.  The PK headlines from Boston were directed at PK specifically, with the intention of making a particular black man a target. These are general statements created for the purpose of trolling a social media team that can't see past their own noses. I wouldn't say these are a fair comparison.  As for it being harder to move on for some than others? Well, all I can say is that for those people, get off the Internet, ASAP. Like I said before, if you are of the mind that every statement on the web is about you, you're in for a bad fucking time.

You seem to believe education and logic are the sole keys to good parenting and discipline, when instinctual urges often trump all logic.

How can the mods even use the word ""harassment"" in their comment? It's like a safe space in here!   Honestly I hate this sub. I want an easy way to see what's happening in gaming and this seems to be the sub that should be able to best give me that.  However the rules on original headlines mean that submissions regularly have awful, misleading titles. ""Dark Souls 3 release date announced"" to make up an example. So you have to click to comments to see the release date, and anyone criticising the title has their comment deleted and is banned.  Also let's not forget the ridiculous over-moderation. Sure no one wants a second /r/gaming, but clearly the moderation is far too extreme. The rules are well-established now, does every thread really need 1/4 of its comments purging and a stickied comment at the top? Deleting comments in this thread about Notepad++ and getting pissy and stickying a comment about it really seems like a waste of time. Why not just let Notepad++ comments get filtered down as would normally happen.

"Not really, since people at this caliber will not understand it either way. I will just go lazy and ctrl c+v the post from Skorbrand, take it or leave it.  &gt;I've fought plenty of people who considered themselves good at parrying and also had many parries to back it up. Do you know what they all do against me now after having a lot of fights against me? They don't try to parry me. When you have 150ms of active frames and you're trying to parry according to the latency, I am able to always read the parry coming after all the experience I have and I can delay 100, 200, 300, 400, or any amount in between. Then if you try again and try to adapt to that delay now I might delay a different amount. Or maybe you parried with me too close to you and you're now backstabbed. Parrying someone as good as me at recognizing them really is just luck because I will usually know it's coming but attack anyways at a more random time to mess up their timing and get free damage. It's a gamble and I win the gamble maybe 19 out of 20 times. Parrying me will lose you more fights than it will win you. Also, we all did used to parry and were all pretty good at it. I stopped parrying many months ago because I wanted to remove any inconsistencies from how I play. You're arguing that they really aren't that inconsistent and you're right, they aren't against bad players, but I can beat them anyways so it doesn't make any difference. There may even be that one fight where I try to parry a bad player but this time I mess up and I end up losing a fight that could have been won by avoiding that risk. It's also bad conditioning for if you run into someone good enough to not get parried. If my answer to a playstyle is to parry it, but now I face this playstyle being used very well, I wouldn't have the practice to more consistently beat them. But by not parrying I always get that practice in so I can play better against anything instead of relying on them playing bad enough to get parried.",-6

Sometimes people don't realise it turns into a tow away zone. It happened to me one time and I didn't do it on purpose. I was in a store getting a procedure done and I asked one of the staff if they could go out and top up the parking meters ( my appointment was taking longer than I expected). What they also failed to realise was that it turns into a clear way after 3pm...   I ended up going out at 4 pm and realising my car was gone... It's then I noticed it had been parked in what turned into a clear way. I called up the police and they informed me that my car was a parked a couple streets away. I wasn't fined for parking in a clear way... (I think the cops could sympathise with my situation) I only had to pay the towing fee.   Don't be so quick to judge. Not everyone is a selfish prick.

It's hard enough to get people to vote as it is, and this candidate is the only one who seems maybe trustworthy in quite some time, and certainly the only one during this race.",-39

"&gt; Madras State, Mysore State, Kerala, Andhra were states formed by vernacular identity and acceded to India on the condition of preserving this in the federalism  And like I said, you can go ahead and keep that identity without imposing your regional language on everyone else. Your identity will not disappear if you use some other language for work.   You gave the example of Malaysia, but did you know that Malaysia contains speakers of 137 living languages, but the official languages are Malay and English? Why can't we have that in India?  &gt; Seeing Kannada in Karnataka irritates you??? Then imagine how Hindi in Karnataka's insurance and banks should irritate?? Would you complain why everything is German in Germany?? Or would a South Indian complain why everything is Bengali in Calcutta?  You are confusing two issues here. German in Germany should not irritate anyone, since it is spoken by MOST Germans. But if official work in West Bengal is being carried out in Bengali, or in Punjabi in Punjab, then it **should** irritate South Indians. We need one standard language in which official work is carried out.   &gt; Which Indians??? What survey?? Tired of shameless liars like you who live in their well.  Huh? I didn't mention any surveys. Which Indians? The ones living in your fucking country. Did you bother to ever step out of your state and talk to them?

There is a difference between opinions and fact.  2. Food is not essential for communication between people.  3. State government choosing which food to serve in its canteen does not effect the functioning of other Indians.  4. I am wasting my time in answering such idiotic comments. Goodbye.",-8

We have reason and we must use it. What reasons do atheists have to live? Pleasure? Helping others? Wealth? Science? All those things are fleeting, and none of them will outlast the heat death of the universe. The fact that many atheists would want to actually live such a life makes me wonder if they really mean what they say, or if their atheism is just a reaction against their inability to cope with the suffering in our world and the wrongdoings of the Church (which Jesus predicted, by the way).",-11

What is stopping air terrorism right now is a population that has learned that if someone hijacks the plane, there is no guarantee it will be landed safely.  These hijackings were somewhat common in the 70s and 80s, but when they changed the rules in 2001, the public learned that sitting back and waiting for others to handle the situation is no longer the safest option. The doors and air marshals were most of what we needed, the public awareness that stops people who get past the TSA anyways is the rest of the answer.  As a supplement to my numbers, I'm going to napkin math really quick.  [In Massachusetts almost a decade ago, we did a survey that said that .5% of the population is trans](http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/health-stats/health-survey/brfss/). Admittedly, this data is very incomplete. We don't have good measures for the actual population, but that's a number that came up from that study. Ballpark 300 million Americans, one in two hundred is trans, gives us 1.5 million trans people.  &gt; The U.S. Department of State reports that only 17 U.S. citizens were killed worldwide as a result of terrorism in 2011. That figure includes deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq and all other theaters of war.  [The goal to beat is 17.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-terrorism-statistics-every-american-needs-to-hear/5382818)  [Using table 6](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf), we get a five percent to nine percent difference for passing, or not passing, difference in suicide rates.  We'll use five percent.  [41 percent of all trans attempted or succeeded](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/lgbt/transgender-suicide/)  So we take 1.5 million people, 41 percent of them (615,000), And the difference between the 36% and 41% (30750).

"I know it seems so obvious that this would be cheating as a third party looking in, but I just can't seem to be absolutely certain of it being more than just a secret fantasy of his that he's not ready to share. This is a relatively unusual fetish, so I see why he would want to keep it from me because of being ashamed/embarrassed.   I'm pretty open-minded and sexually explorative, but I know I would never partake in something like this if he were to ask. Is it right for me to tell him, ""you're not allowed to have this fetish""? Because that's what would have to change obviously. He thought he had a safe place to be able to explore this fantasy and I know it would be nearly impossible for me to talk to him about it for many reasons. So if it is clearly cheating, which I don't stand for, I would have to just break up with him. No explanation. Which is also something that I don't think I could bring myself to do.  ",-12

The fact that he's learned the game at the level he has, given his disadvantage, is impressive, but you're nuts if you think he's actually a threat at the tournament level.  Brolylegs is an example of a guy who's got a major disability but is a legit threat on a local, regional and national level because his disability doesn't prevent him from engaging in the most important part of the game.    All these kinds of articles always overstate the individual's potential at the expense of the game itself.  If the game was really so simple that a blind person could place well at tournaments, then it wouldn't really be worth playing.  There's no way you can avoid being baited or play a precise spacing game when you can't see and have to rely purely on audio cues.  A blind baseball player might be able to develop a killer swing, but their hit rate is still going to be lousy.

"Alcohol. *dodges daggers* okay let me explain.   Alcohol is so fucking terrible for you. Think about it this way; every time you take a sip of alcohol, your body freaks the fuck out. ""WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU POISONING ME?!"" Alcohol is a legal way of poisoning your own body.   Now, there are always exceptions to the rule. Having a glass of red wine every so often isn't bad due to the fact that red wine is packed with antioxidants.   But in the reality of things, as a college student, is pretty bleak. I've seen people die from alcohol, people who were my friends. Not to be too much of a lobbyist here, but smoke Marijuana instead. Some say it makes your body feel drunk but your head is clear and alert. Personally, it relaxes me and eases my chronic back and knee pain. Something that alcohol may do when consumed in copious amounts, but it makes you feel like shit and it kills your liver. ",-9

"- Why is the S7 edge a 5.5"" phone instead of 5.1""? Consistency.. Samsung does not have it. Why not just do the edge and edge plus again?   - No USB-C, how silly. Make fun of apple all you want for 'proprietary' lightning, but everybody has it on all their Apple devices and then within a year or 2, it's fully adopted. The android space returning to fragmentation..   - SD slot back, that'll bring back a lot of fans who angrily left Samsung when the S6 was released, but still no removable battery right? Whatever, that just means more optimized internal space   - camera is likely leaps and bounds better than the 6s/6s+ because Apple entirely stagnated this year and even reduced the pixel size that they have bragged about for so long since Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4 for general quality and low light performance. I haven't seen test pictures, but given that it's the next gen camera, and they elected to reduce the resolution to 12 mp so as to make the pixels bigger, that was a super smart move and much better than the silly 13 or 16 mp bragging about spec sheets when iPhone's 8 mp cameras were still outperforming every android phone  - do they have a tap fingerprint scanner yet instead of single direction swipe? I forget if the S6 fixed this and I didn't see if this did edit: yep! S6 did. Cool  - IP68 certified, awesome. Apple needs to do this this year. It would be a waste of the momentous removing of the headphone jack to not use that time to market the phone as 'fewest holes of any phone ever' or something, meaning that it could be maybe more than IP68 if they chose to do so   Edit: headphone jack? BLASHPHEMY! Jk :P It would've been funny though if they removed it based on rumors of the iPhone 7 and then it turned out Apple was just putting out fake controlled leaks.   Will never understand /r/Apple. Question: thoughts on S7? Gives thoughts on S7. Gets downvoted. ",-8

Pulse ratings should never be used to determine a safe rating for any battery period. For maximum safety the milliamp rating draining the battery over an hour is the only really safe and reliable way to use a battery and get the expected life and durability. You can push these limits within reason. For an 18650 anything over 5 or 6 amps is unsafe. I know people have been pushing the amperages to extreme limits and have the knowledge to do so quite successfully with no serious incidents. Some claim and believe they are well versed in battery safety. Rule number one is: Do not abuse the battery.,-11

In fact, since the framework itself should be platform-agnostic, there's no reason why you couldn't develop the actual rendering as a module of the core functions, meaning that you could just leave it to someone else to write the rendering the widgets for a Linux version.

What Faker did was just use the flash to lure both enemies down the wrong path maximizing the flash efficiency (enemies can assume from their vision that he flashed the wall but had to check). As soon as they checked the bush Faker had a good chance to juke the q while he wouldn't have if he ran upwards and just flashed the small wall because he had no way to run downwards making his likely escapepath the same as his only way.,-6

"The problem isn't that we're some delusional echo chamber.    It's just a situation which has developed in which we are one of the most active subreddits.    Every comparatively active subreddit is a very general platform with a broad theme.  /r/SandersForPresident, on the other hand, is a community with a very clear goal of getting a presidential candidate elected.  Given this situation, we are doomed to look like an echo chamber to the rest of reddit.  Even if only the most modest, uncontroversial posts made it to /r/all, people would still be calling us an echo chamber.  Yes, it really is saying something.  What it says is that this grassroots movement has so much traction online that we are one of the most active subreddits.  That's it.   Posts that you see from here aren't necessarily written for a general public audience.  They are often written as strategic brainstorming for the /r/SandersForPresident community.  It's only due to the workings of reddit that the most popular of these become so visible to the rest of reddit.  If I knew that this post would gain this much traction and be seen outside the community, I certainly would have worded it a lot more carefully, especially the title.  But that isn't how reddit works.    Sure, to an outsider this looks over the top.  From a standpoint of strategic planning it makes perfect sense.  The Clinton campaign has been hammering very hard for months on the messages that she is more electable and has more experience.  These are not facts by any means, but they are cited in exit polling as the top reasons when people choose Clinton over Sanders.  It actually is a fact that Sanders outperforms Clinton in head-to-head polling against Republicans, and it is also is a fact that, in terms of years, he does have more experience.    Certainly these are not definitive arguments that prove the claims in the title of my post, and certainly there are plenty of valid counter arguments to what I'm asserting.    These assertions are still arguable points with legitimate numbers to back them up.    The Clinton campaign is winning the messaging on these issues not by citing facts, but by asserting that since most people hadn't heard about him until recently and Clinton's been a household name for decades, that he has a fraction of the experience she does, and by asserting that all Americans fall on some binary political spectrum which automatically makes candidates who are too far from some presumed center ""unelectable.""  Again, this was meant as a strategic brainstorm for the /r/SandersForPresident, not a direct message to the world outside of our community.  In politics, countering misleading messaging by saying.  ""Not exactly, because....."" doesn't win.    Saying confidently that ""Actually, Sanders is more electable, and this is why...."" is a much more effective strategy.  I hope this clears things up at least a little bit.",-9

It also doesn't explain why the henchmen took so long to figure this out or the dumb bus hitting the guy plan.  The bus hitting the guy and the delivery of the lines to establish the character was cool but it is also foreshadowing all the convoluted plans and plots that when you think about them don't really hold water.  3. That was a different pile of money.  But yeah he wanted a ton of money to burn.  What difference does it make if a henchman or two has a few hundred grand of walking around money.

"A lot of Libertarian ideas sound fantastic on paper and fall apart once you start thinking of real world examples. This is one of them.  The idea is that in a perfect free market if someone started discriminating against people like jews and blacks people would stop going there and competitors would open up and put them out of business.   Which is likely true in most parts of the country. Someone tries to pull that in a mid to large city and it wouldn't really work. But there are plenty of rural places that could easily run any 'undesirable' out by practices such as this. Which is why I disagree that the idea of businesses being able to refuse anyone for any reason. There should be some protected classes. ",-24

"So let's do some math.  Bernie has a salary of $174,000, which he's made for about 25 years.  Roughly $40,000 of that goes to income and state taxes, another $20,000 for payroll taxes.  **Meaning he brings in $114,000 every year in net revenue**  After 25 years he should have made $2.85 million.

"I love how there's all this ""technical"" talk about turbos in F1, as if car guys have no idea how turbochargers work. I realize not everybody is a car person but still.  Closed wastegates don't ""cause a silencing effect"". The silencing effect comes from the turbocharger itself. Because all the engine's combustion pulses meet at the turbo, they basically get blended together which reduces frequency and sound peaks, resulting in a muddy sound. You can hear this on these F1 cars, street cars, rally cars, diesels, airplanes, anything with a turbo.  An open wastegate, or a wastegate dump, or a screamer pipe, or whatever you want to call it, doesn't change the sound of the muddied turbo exhaust. It does create its own sound, however. And it's not so much ""sound"" as blaring, whooshing white noise.  Here, you can hear the wastegate dump really obviously:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL4zC4UNNDI  Here, you can hear it at high rpm:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5B79qrgiLw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAxJoJUrCzo  Anyways, there's no magic to this system. I find the press that it's getting hilarious because F1 is now using the same technology that hoodrat car guys have been doing for decades just to make more racket and piss off rich people. Open wastegate dumps. Go find a kid with a ratty 240SX with an SR20 swap and Ebay parts galore, he'll have ""F1 technology"" on his car, purely because it's obnoxious.  EDIT: It's also slightly beneficial to creating power because separating waste exhaust from the turbo outlet prevents the two exhaust streams from interfering with each other. In general, to make power with a turbo you want as free an exhaust flow as possible, thus big, short pipes. A recirculating wastegate simply complicates that process.",-10

I promise Ruth will hurt DD1 and tell the girl to keep her mouth shut or ""you'll be the reason the family falls apart"" or some other threat.  Your husband has a choice. He can protect his vulnerable child or he can enable her abuser. For that matter he can stand with his wife or support her abuser. But please, do not let her hurt DD1. You are a grown woman. He is a grown man. His mother is a grown woman. The person at risk here is the child who depends on her parents to keep her safe and she will continue to be at risk so long as Ruth is around. ",58

"Head &amp; face shower shave. 2 days growth.  **Technique**:  WTG / XTG / ATG/clean-up.  **Prep**: Shower.        **Soap**: Dapper Dragon Soaps - Festival (Summer 2015 LE)  **Brush**: Omega PRO48  **Razor**: Above The Tie - S1 w/Triad Rolling Hex 316 Brushed Stainless handle  **Blade**: Astra Superior Platunum(2)  **Post**: Dapper Dragon Soaps - Festival Scale Polish   It's probably been a year or more since I've used the PRO48.  I've only had 2 complaints about this brush in the past:  Number one, the handle looks and feels cheap.  I remedied the heft issue by filling it with plumbers putty.  As a result, it has nice balance.  The cheap faux chrome finish cannot be overcome, however.  My other complaint was that being a head and face shaver, the sheer size of the knot contributed to difficulty lathering the narrow area between the lateral canthi of my eyes and my ears.  I would invariably get lather in my eyes.  This issue has since been overcome by technique.  When I face/scalp lather, I achieve a formidable lather in other locations.  There's no need to whip up a lather in that small location.  I simply paint that area with pre-formed lather.  Problem solved.  And ""paint"" is the right word to use for this brush.  The knot size is actually ideal for shaving my meaty dome, and it easily holds enough lather for 3 head and face passes with some to spare.  Dapper Dragon is yet another product I've neglected.  I suspect this is because there are simply so many talented artisans out there, that some can be pushed to the back of the den simply due to the numbers.  Dapper Dragon performs as well as most of the other fine artisans in my collection.  It's at least in my top 5, and with regard to slickness, specifically, it's a leader.  Festival is one of the most unique scents I've experienced.  About a year ago, in my initial review of Festival, I said:  The scent profile for Festival according to Dapper Dragon is, ""…summer blooming honeysuckle, watermelons, strawberries, and an intriguing base of smoke and gunpowder to evoke the feeling of summer festivals around the world.""  Who couldn't pass that up?  Clearly, I need to go to some of the summer festivals that Eric Honaker attends, because there are a few other aromas associated with summer festivals I won't soon forget...sweat, cheap beer, marijuana, and do you remember Zima?  But I digress…  Off the puck, I get a nondescript cucumber scent that's reminiscent of cosmetic cream product.  As most of us know, you should never base your impression from the ""puck notes"" alone.  As soon as the wet knot hits the puck, the scent explodes into summertime melons including watermelon and honeydew.  I should note the watermelon smells like fresh split warm watermelon---not the contrived excessively sweet scent found in candies and teenies' lip gloss.  With time, the scent unfolds and watermelon is overtaken by rich, slightly musky, honeysuckle that is gently brightened by very light notes of strawberry.  Due to my constant exposure to gunpowder (we have spent shells in crystal bowls where normal people probably have after-dinner mints), I've become a bit nose-blind to it, but there are times in which I catch hints of a faintly metallic note and gun powder, but it is quite subdued to me.  By now, you've probably all heard my singing the praises of Scale Polish, so if you've heard it before, you may as well stop reading now.  It's just a very underrated product.  It's definitely not a splash, but neither is it a balm.  The consistency reminds me of a homemade concoction I used to make in my early days of head shaving when not every shave went so well.  My concoction was a simple aloe gel base with witch hazel and tea tree oil added.  Because it didn't smell so great, I added a couple drops of lavender essential oil to the mix.  I used it as a rescue product.  It worked, but it left a tacky feel to my scalp that I typically would feel the need to rinse off a couple hours later when the initial discomfort from the bad shave had subsided.  Scale Polish is much more refined than my little concoction.  It's an aloe gel thinned down with witch hazel, jojoba oil, dimethicone, and menthol.  To apply the product, I simply dip my dry finger into the tub and whatever adheres is plenty.  I would imagine face-only shavers would need to only touch the product to achieve a sufficient amount.  This is why a 2 oz. container goes a long way.  You simply apply it to your moist skin and briefly work it in.  I rarely have irritating shaves anymore, but I still reach for the Scale Polish simply because it feels great and leaves an almost powdered feeling to my scalp.  There's no tackiness, sheen, or plastic-wrapped appearance as can be the case with some aloe based products. The initial wetness dissipates about as quickly as most alcohol-based splashes, but the coolness lingers for much longer.  The only exception, in my experience, would be the high-menthol splashes like Fine's Snake Bite, but without the harshness. It is comfortably cool, but not numbingly so (It should be noted that Dapper Dragon offers an unscented version of Scale Polish both with and without menthol).  The scent of the Scale Polish matches the soap perfectly.   My only complaint about any of the Dapper Dragon products be considered a small one by most.  The labels on some of their products are just atrocious.  Some of my earlier purchases of Black Dragon, Green Dragon, and even Festival are fine except they do not contain a label on the side of the puck.  A re-design brings a side label, but the ink flakes off readily.  One has to take care to avoid the large pieces of label making it into the product itself.  I even received Autumn Morn in a state that was essentially illegible.  Dapper Dragon promptly replaced the label, but the issue exists for all my Scale Polishes (I have a matching scent for each DD soap I own.)  I feel certain /u/songwind will address this issue as it is a glaring one.  This was a very enjoyable shave using products that have unduly been neglected.  I assume Festival will be back this Summer.  If so, I recommend you pick it up!",7

Wunderlist - The best list app on Windows 10 by far, owned now by MS so the app is a full UWP and is a pleasure to use. You can pin individual lists to start as well which is useful.  Readit - Mentioned by a lot of people here but it really is fantastic.  There are a number of apps in development I am very much looking forward to like Facebook, Messenger and the new Deezer app. I think developers with W8 apps need to get them updated. A majority of apps in the store look outdated or are completely broken.   Another point to mention is that it depends what sort of device you are using I think as to whether you use these apps at all. On my main PC I don't use them, but on my SP4 they are all I use since most are based around touch. Also since they are sandboxed packages they don't leave crap behind when you uninstall them which is a bonus. ",7

"The MatchMaker doesn't necessarily put you in matches it wants you to lose after you're on a streak-- you are gaining MMR from winstreaks and therefore are getting matched with tougher enemies (and by extension have a better chance at an even/losing game). This continues *until* you hit VG or manage to lose. Such is an ELO/MMR system, that's just how it goes.  As to what you can do if you feel like you will lose, for any reason, is focus on something you're not good at.  Perhaps you have awful map awareness. Well, if you aren't going to win, at least be aware of where enemy Flares are going, the minion wave, your allies' position. Check these in the minimap every 5 seconds (Of course you should guesstimate how long 5 seconds is, don't actually watch the in-game clock to see when every 5 seconds is up lol). That sort of thing. If you are over-aggressive come late game, focus on waiting for your team to decide when to go in rather than choosing for them. There are tons of options.

"Of course. My point is that Kissinger would have never gotten the same prominence under that administration, both because of that and because of the time period.   &gt;And outside of US, Nixon is mostly remembered for Watergate  This is actually untrue in Russia, China, Vietnam, and Israel, each for obvious reasons. Or, at least it was with older generations. Possible that younger ones are different, especially due to the influence of  American pop culture.  Many foreign governments, even Western European ones, had a hard time processing Watergate-that they privately agreed with Nixon and Kissinger when they complained about the relative importance of ""a third rate burglary"" to foreign events at the time was of little use in the firestorm of Watergate era US politics. Of course, if they had trouble understanding it, you could imagine what governments with a less than perfect understanding of the mechanics of democracy-many of whom thought highly of the Nixon Administration, since they strongly liked the fact that Nixon and Kissinger didn't bug them with ""happytalk"" about human rights and values and just got down to business, unlike most Americans-thought. It's interested to see what each individual government thought of it, and how it reflected his nation. The Kremlin was military-industrial-Zionist conspiracy-thinking oriented, Mao wondered why Nixon didn't just line up the Washington Post workers and shoot them, Assad thought the Israel lobby was at work, among others.  My favorite part of the time period is when Dick and Henry talked to the dictators of the world about Watergate, and the common response with a sympathetic, shocked nod was a variation of: ""In our country, Watergate would never happen."" They should know, because they had the death lists and torture centers to prove it, of course...  But inside the US, he is. As he should be. ",7

"I'm surprised Raikou lost to Chandelure. I know Chandelure is a popular Pokemon and is even in Pokken Tournament, but yikes...   These are my guesses on the next round's wins.   Entei vs. Xerneas: This is a tough one, but Xerneas may have this one in the bag considering Raikou lost to Chandelure.  Flygon vs Quilava; I can't see Flygon losing to a NFE Pokemon.  Milotic vs. Kabutops: It's a tough call, but I think Kabutops will win this one.   Snorlax vs. Porygon-Z: I think Snorlax will win this one.   Archeops vs. Froakie: Froakie is a starter, and arguably one of the more popular starters at that.   Nidoking vs Espeon: Nidoking has been around for much longer and was even part of the Super Bowl commercial, so it may win this one.   Jolteon vs. Houndoom: Jolteon was around for much longer, but Houndoom has a Mega Evolution. It's a tough call, but I can see Houndoom winning.  Chesnaught vs. Zapdos: Zapdos was one of the original Legendary Bird Pokemon. Chesnaught is one of the new starters. I think Zapdos will win.  Mewtwo vs. Cyndaquil: Bye Cyndaquil.   Togekiss vs. Talonflame: I can't see Talonflame losing this time.   Yveltal vs. Dragonite: It's a tough call, but I can see Dragonite beating Yveltal.   Absol vs. Dragonair: Dragonair may have been around for a lot longer than Absol has, but it is not as popular as its evolved form Dragonite. Absol also has a Mega Evolution. I can't see Absol losing.   Hawlucha vs. Togepi: Hawlucha stands out by being the only Fighting/Flying Pokemon, and by having a really good speed tier and a unique move. Togepi was around for much longer, and it had a strong presence in the anime. I think Togepi will win.   Latias vs. Zoroark: Zoroark may be popular, but I can't see it being Latias.   Mew vs. Infernape: I think Mew will win this one. It is the most popular and oldest Mythical Pokemon by far, and Infernape doesn't have a Mega Evolution or competitive viability to make it stand out.  Venusaur vs. Kingdra: Venusaur is the evolved form of the first Grass starter, was competitively viable on its own during the weather wars last generation, and has a viable Mega Evolution during this generation. I can't see Venusaur losing to something like Kingdra.  Glaceon vs. Staraptor: I think Staraptor will win this one. It is one of the more recognizable Sinnoh Pokemon for being the region's ""early bird.""   Ampharos vs. Torterra: Ampharos was around for much longer and has a Mega Evolution. Torterra may have a unique type, but I can't see it beating Ampharos.  Dusknoir vs. Shinx: I don't know how Shinx lasted this long, but it is Sinnoh's early Electric-type. Maybe Shinx will win this time, too. Dusknoir doesn't really stand out imo.   Froslass vs. Meganium: Meganium was around longer, so I can see it winning.   Giratina vs. Scizor: Scizor is one of the most popular Gen 2 Pokemon, has a Mega Evolution, and is competitively viable even in its base form. Scizor was also around for a much longer period of time, so I can't see it losing.   Umbreon vs. Typhlosion: Typhlosion is Gen 2's Fire starter and, at least on here, is the evolution of the most commonly picked Johto starter. I can't see it losing.   Azumarill vs. Heracross: This is a tough call indeed. Heracross was one of those Pokemon that always stood out in competitive play. It also has a Mega Evolution. Azumarill, conversely, only became really viable at the start of Gen 6, but it is a really good Pokemon regardless. I can see this going either way, but I think Heracross has the edge. ",11

"First he stated ""essentially no water cycle"". It was never said that there is no rain ever. The point is there is not enough to produce a noticeable change in the effect being discussed.   Second, I think most of this sub accepts that these plot holes exist. The difference is we choose to discuss and think about them instead of simply sweeping them under the rug. Simply ignoring any universes short comings doesn't really help them become richer and more immersive. But actively discussing them and creatively looking for explanations to the aspects of the lore which the developer might have omitted, is strongly beneficial to both the community and the franchise. It's fine to disagree with another persons perspective, but simply writing the whole thing off as false without contributing doesn't really achieve anything.

"No, they don't.  Not even close.  I had this pair of speakers in high school.  There's nothing good about them.  They use the cheapest paper drivers, the crossover is the cheapest possible, and they use terrible 1/2"" thick MDF.  Probably less than $10 of components in each.  Without getting too far into it, speaker design made a radical change around the year 2000.  That was when computers became powerful enough to model speakers.  That changed everything.  Speaker design used to take months of revisions and testing.  With computers, you could do that in a matter of hours.  Designs became a lot better.  Materials science also took a huge leap.  Much, much better materials were developed that offer better performance than paper cones.  Magnets became more powerful and more efficient.  Computer modeling made the drivers better than anything that had come before.  Recently, some speakers have gotten active crossovers.  Most crossovers are passive - a collection of resistors, capacitors and inductors.  The new ones have a computer that analyzes the music and constantly changes the crossover for optimum performance.  To be fair, the typical consumer speakers found in big box stores and from big online retailers aren't very good.  Those are designed with the ""Smiley Face EQ"" that boosts the highs and the lows.  The average consumer listens for thumping bass and sparkly highs, so the smiley face moves product.  In truth, humans are most sensitive to the midrange.  That's because the human voice is in the midrange and our brains are wired to be very sensitive to those frequencies.    There is absolutely zero comparison between these speakers and the best of 2016.  This is like saying that a 1986 Ford Escort is pretty much the same as a 2016 Corvette because they're both cars and all cars are alike.  If you can, go listen to good speakers at a high-end audio shop.  Be sure to bring some of your favorite music to audition with.  The first thing that will happen is that you'll notice all sorts of detail in your favorite music that you had no idea was there.  When you pick your jaw up off the floor, come by /r/audiophile.  We'll help you find that incredible sound on whatever budget you have.  Truly good headphones start around $75-$100.  Truly good speakers start around $130.

"This case seems really strange to me for several reasons. After going over your comments, this is what I've been able to discern so far:   * You're insisting you've *never been hacked* and there is no way someone else has performed the ToS-breaching activity you're apparently being accused of because you use the steam app verification.   I can theorize from this that either you're completely mistaken, or the hacking incidents are false-positives because you tend to visit very different locales (like Romania) which may lead to suspicions of hacking if you log into steam from vastly different areas. For now, we'll trust your suggestion that you've never been hacked, and that the likely issue behind the false hacking assumptions is location switches.   * You've ticketed nearly a dozen times with negative responses **after investigations by Steam.**   This is a little concerning. Not one but two separate customer support teams (Accounts Issues and Steam Client support) have now received and investigated multiple tickets from you and arrived at the same conclusions.   * Steam threatened to go to the police.   This is pretty rare, and rather alarming. They don't just throw that around without looking into things.  * Eventual flat out ignoring.   This usually indicates multiple people have looked at your account and your tickets, and a manager has flagged you as DNR. They don't do that lightly. I don't work for nor represent Steam, so I'm not 100% on their policies, but we can make some reasonable assumptions here that ""just ignore him he's annoying and we can't be assed to waste time on the customer who spends thousands of dollars"" wasn't a conversation that happened.   * Several emails to GabeN  I'm adding this in here because the guy has a habit of responding to pretty much everything, and has a reputation for personally responding to tickets, especially ones posted here. It's been 3 hours, so we'll give him some time, but really his input into whats going on is the clincher for me, or another valve employee. Reason being, I only have *your* side of the story, and unfortunately things don't look good for you.   **My conclusion:**  OP and his account has been investigated by two different Steam services and multiple employees from each, and all of them arrived at the conclusion he has violated the ToS, and thus been banned.   Even though Steam hasn't the best (or even noteworthy?) customer service sometimes, logic dictates that it is **far** more likely that OP is guilty than an act of such grandiose negligence/incompetence on the part of multiple Steam employees. We're talking a level of fuck up here that is framed and pointed out to future employees on what not to do. Threatening to call the cops cause they can't tell the difference between a legit hacker's activities and OP's regular behaviour after ~3ish years of you using your account without apparent incident? Two different Steam teams buggering up in the exact same ways? Putting him, a customer who spends a boat load of money, on DNR without fully investigating his ""obvious"" innocence? Yeaaaah okay, OP.    But! We will see. Perhaps GabeN will swing by with a ""wow, oops"" or another employee. Very likely we will see GabeN swing by and post [this](http://fat.gfycat.com/SoupyCautiousCat.gif) and then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mnYLPxwtc) and promptly leave.     **EDIT:**  &gt;You can see that I almost only sell items/keys for cash.  ...Where is it you get your keys/items from that you sell? I suspect you have been reported by other players because they have purchased non-functioning/temp game keys from you, whether or not you were aware of it. I'm not very familiar with the Steam trading services but AFAIK you can't trade for cash, so you've got to be using outsider trading like Paypal or what have you. Not to mention the items.  Also, keep in mind Steam can and *does* read your chat logs through Steam, so if one of your customers messaged you and said ""hey whats the deal"" and you said ""lol thanks for the money scrub,"" that could be why Steam was able to shut you down without much effort. They also *can't* see what you do outside Steam, so if you've been receiving stolen goods and paying for them with Paypal, it literally will look like your account is a mule for stolen games without you being able to prove you aren't. Thus b&amp;.  **EDIT 2 and 3:**  Okay, it is mostly CSGO junk.   **I've pretty much seen all I need to see now, people.**  Paraphrasing,[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/46mndh/im_being_ignored_by_steam_and_this_has_been_going/d06jfq5) &gt;I may trade with scammers, I don't know. The ToS only says I *shouldn't* trade outside of Steam with Paypal/Bitcoin cause I'll probably end up working with scammers, it doesn't say that I'm not allowed to. I shouldn't be banned because I thought to myself, ""So what? Only idiots end up working with scammers, Steam is just being silly"" and then ended up working with scammers *after thousands of transactions.*    *""No, John. You are the demons. And then, ~~John~~ OP was a ~~zombie~~ scammer.""*  **You can't buy broken/stolen game keys, stolen CSGO keys/items and sell them to people and then [go like this](http://a1.web.wt-cdn.com/post_items/images/000/034/583/original/shrug_gif.gif) and expect Steam not to get angry when they get irrate tickets from your screwed-over customers.**  *Ignorantia juris non excusat,* you can't ignore the warnings of the ToS not to trade outside of Steam because the enormous likelihood of scamming, complete thousands of transactions, and then go ""woops, yeah I sold a whole bunch of people stolen games, but I had a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy with the guys providing the games, so it isn't my fault because technically I didn't know.""   **You can't traffic stolen goods, man.**     *: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/46mndh/im_being_ignored_by_steam_and_this_has_been_going/d06jfq5 read that comment tree for non-paraphrased versions of the quote I posted.    **EDIT 4:**  &gt;This is how I trade. I buy cheap items from different websites such as opskins, bitskins, etc... I then trade those items for keys or overpay in items (which I then sell for keys) once I get a good amount of keys I sell them for paypal and bitcoins and start all over again. **I could be unknowningly trafficking stolen keys but I wouldn't be the 1st one in line** if that makes sense (like I would buy them off of legit traders who prob bought them off of scammers or something)  [I understand, I do.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/877/239/d40.gif) It matters not where in the line you are, what matter is *you're in the damn line in the first place.* Steam **cannot** differentiate between your account and one of the many other mules the stolen goods have been passed through *because you operated outside of Steam.* GabeN is, unfortunately for you, not omniscient, despite prior claims of this sub.   **EDIT 5:**  Neato, gold. Thanks so much! I only wish I had earned it under more positive circumstances, [cause I kinda feel like this.](http://i.imgur.com/JIOSZ3t.jpg)    Off topic, did anyone else feel like they were talking to Carl from *Llamas With Hats* when talking to OP?  &gt;They banned me for no reason!

"Don't tell him.  Don't tell her.  Just...  work through how you feel.  Seriously.  This will vanish in a few months, or if it doesn't, people have held crushes for years.  There is NOTHING wrong with loving more than one person.  If I had kids, I would love each one  in a different way.  I love my mother as much as my father, but the love is different.  Just like the love I hold for my grandparents is different.  The idea that there is only one person you can feel a romantic love for is crazy.  Cheating, of course, is wrong.  But feeling love for someone isn't.  just don't hurt anyone.  Spend some time thinking about it.  let your feelings develop.  They'll probably fade.  Maybe they won't.    Maybe one day you'll talk about it.  Maybe you won't.  Maybe one day you'll be in a *consentual* and *happy* relationship with two *consentual* adults, (after all, not all threesomes have all three people interacting sexually.  Sometimes they simply interact sexually only with one partner) and that would be okay.   but right now, you're feeling crush feelings.  And those are delicate sparks that can flare up or die out easily.    You're an adult.  You can feel without needing to act on it.  ...  and while you think about these feelings, perhaps try and figure out what it is about her that attracts you to her, and if it's something your husband doesn't or can't provide.  but above all else, don't act rashly.

"I hear you. This, “I didn’t know it would hurt you” line is the oldest trick in an abusive parent’s book.  It’s a close cousin to “I don’t remember it that way” and “I don’t understand why you’re mad.” If you ask the estranged adult offspring in RBN if they had been fed this line, probably 95% of them would raise their hands. If you ask how many of them fell for it, you’d see a lot of hands, too. Someone even [wrote a poem about it]( https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/42t421/hey_mom_remember_when/)   &gt;""Omg I didn't know I was so fucked up""  The fact is, Western culture is hysterical about pedophilia. (Not that I’ve forgotten your age, but pedophile stigma is relevant to your father’s supposed ignorance.) Pedophilia and incest are all over TV. They’re all over the news. One of the longest running popular shows, *SVU*, is pretty much dedicated to them. *To Catch a Predator* is also in the public imagination. It’s in our jokes, it’s in discussion about what clothes are marketed to little girls, people even bring it up on the radio when discussing boy bands. It’s everywhere. There is no chance that a man who is old enough to be called “creep” could exist in this culture and not be aware of the stigma. There is no chance that, when he said and did the things he chose to say and do, he did not understand that he had gone beyond the pale. None.     *What else could he have been hoping for* in saying ""I want to see you naked."" Do you think he would have been the bigger person and turned you down if you had succumbed to his clumsy seduction? There's just no way you can re-write this in a way that butter could melt in his mouth.   I wish there was a book I could recommend that explains the twisted thinking that goes into playing innocent like that.  “Down the Rabbit Hole,” a study of forums for estranged parents, circles near it but doesn’t seem specific enough. Dear Sugar's essay on ""The Empty Bowl"" may console you. I can tell you my own experience and direct you to the experience of others on RBN. Maybe seeing that ""I don't understand"" claim paired with abuse that isn’t personal to you will make you see how ridiculous it is.  Here’s how I encountered that line: When I was younger, and if my mom was mad at one of the kids, when the kid got in the car, my mom would drive crazily. None of us confronted her about it, we would just sit in the car as if nothing was happening. Terrified. We didn’t tell our father it was happening. No one talked about it.  Years later when she “didn’t understand why I was mad,” I brought this up with her on the phone. So deep was she into her own bullshit, that after the phone call, 3,000 miles away, she woke up my brother and demanded to know if that had really happened. Was that all an act? Was she past the point of believing her own bullshit? I’ll never know, and my mental health is better if I put the question aside. But the point is, there is no chance that an action meant to terrorize a child could be misunderstood by the perpetrator at the time it occured. It was deliberate. Just as asking to see one's daughter naked is deliberate. These actions don't come about without thought.    &gt; there was no mention of ""I'll try again when you get therapy"". I never said that.   Doesn't mean your father can't put two and two together and hope to win you back. Doesn't mean he's not concerned with how other people would see him, and saying ""I knew I was being creepy when I said what I did"" won't win him any popularity contest. It's also not an easy story to tell himself.      &gt;I'm just wondering if it's crazy to be willing to try again after he gets legit help and takes it seriously.   It would be crazy to be willing to try again with him. Your desire to beleive his tranparent lies shows that you are so, so vulnerable right now. He is your blind spot.  Treat him like a radiactive poison and don't expose yourself! He is not a person you can trust with your mental health.    ",48

"Miscarriages happen at any stage of the pregnancy.  Early term miscarriages can even go almost unnoticed when compared to a menstrual cycle.  Later term miscarriages can be dealt with by a doctor physically removing dead tissue (much like an abortion).  However if the fetus dies close to term then it is unfortunately common that the woman will either have to deliver the dead fetus vaginally or have a c-section and go through the trauma of giving birth, but no happy cries at the end of it.

"&gt;I'm rather sure it's the opposite of radicalized anarchism.  Yeah, it is. I don't understand what you're getting at.  &gt;You don't even know what Sander's take on a two state solution is, thus your ""Zionist"" remark can only be construed as hate speech as there was no argument to discuss it further, and your follow up attempt to use Israel as an example of him only solidifies the fact that a ""jew is a jew"" is your type of speech.  I understand what the two state solution is, it's the right solution. However, his actual actions have made me believe that he supports Israel; as I wrote, he's voted, along with all of congress, in support of Israel and blames Hamas for everything.  Once again, I did make a legitimate argument, you just chose to ignore it. For someone to support Israel the way you do, they'd have to be incredibly ignorant or incredibly misinformed. Let's try again and see if you listen this time. The Palestinian people are the indigenous people of that area. [Here's what the land distribution looked like in 1947 contrasted to 2000.](http://www.ifamericansknew.org/images/FourMaps2.png) As you can see, they've had the vast majority of their land taken from them as a result of imperialism. In order to do that, the state of Israel has killed countless civilians and committed numerous war crimes. [""On the Palestinian side, 2,251 people, 1,462 of them civilians, were killed, the UN says. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians.""](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33700343) Unfortunately, I could link things like this all day. [Here's an instance of Israel bombing a hospital, which I'm sure you know, is an international war crime.](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/middle-east-unrest/another-gaza-hospital-hit-israeli-strike-four-dead-40-hurt-n161086) The Israeli state, as you can see, is an occupying force that's done everything they can to ethnically cleanse the entire region, killed civilians including children, bombed hospitals, etc. and the U.S. supports them out of strategic interests. Scholars like Noam Chomsky have called Israel a ""terrorist state."" Is this the type of thing you support? Can you give any argument as to why, other than saying I'm anti-Semitic or whatever?   &gt;Yes, go ahead and move into the woods, with Ammon Bundy. He needs more supporters. He might be in jail now, but you'll get your free tax-less bologna sandwich each afternoon.  I don't understand why, in America, people get so hostile when someone criticizes capitalism. You can have debates about abortion, about taxes, about marriage, etc. but you absolutely cannot say anything bad about capitalism. Capitalism is absolutely infallible and can't be discussed! Look at what you just said. You're telling me to leave society and go live in the woods just because I disagree with you on the economic system. There wasn't even a discussion, just hostility, people calling me un-American, doxxing me, digging through my post history to post about my medical conditions. Absolutely pathetic.  &gt;I was alive when the cold war was hot and heavy. Not during the cuban missile crisis, but you better believe I remember quite clearly the berlin wall falling down; I literally have a piece of it in my house, from an engineering student that brought it back from when he was there as an overseas student. In fact, when I took Deutsch in high school, there was still the DDR, and I certainly fucking remember Reagan, the star wars program, the iran contra affair, the russians in afghanistan, the central american proxy wars, lebanon, the iran-iraq war, desert shield, desert storm, and have friends that got fucked up or killed in some, so I feel I have a bit of an attachment to that shit. I'm not saying anyone has to be pro-war, but don't confuse me with someone that didn't live through that.  I didn't ask for your life story. You didn't even bother to refute my point, that your first instinct was to regurgitate bullshit McCarthyist Cold War propaganda at me.   ",9

"&gt; I am totally in this science-atheist camp, but that's because I've done the background on philosophy and thought it was pretty clear that philosophy is not attempting to describe reality.   I disagree with this, even though I agree with your basic premise.  The *very worst* philosophy *does* try to describe reality.  That trainwreck where Anslem decides [a perfect god would exist](http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/anselm.shtml) (just the same way [a perfect girlfriend would](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3066)) is an example of this.  It's trying to use our words - which are concepts that imperfectly and sometimes sloppily match up to reality - to show what does and does not exist, or how the universe does or does not work.  That's philosophy at it's worst, and it's the type atheists face regularly.  So it's understandable why ""we"" think philosophy is so bad.  But *good* philosophy *explicitly* does what you deride - it doesn't try to describe the universe.  Or rather, it does, and when it doesn't match up, it feeds back on itself to realize that our concepts and words are *wrong.*  The great chicken-and-egg debate, for instance, should have led to this.  Neither could come first - but in hindsight we realize that our teleological concept of ""chicken"" was flawed; and it wasn't a fixed category.  Philosophy that looks for those sorts of conflicts is good philosophy.  It's also, in my experience, exceedingly rare.  I tell myself that's because I only know popular philosophy the way most people only know popular science, so I just don't see it the way readers of ""popular"" science writing don't see much good science.",6

"I would say that not dating someone because of their height and not dating someone because of their race are actually pretty similar. They're both characteristics you can't control.  For example someone could be very ""nice looking"" but be too short/too tall (for your preference). You can still appreciate how they look you just might not be attracted to them. Same with race, a person could see a person of a different race and think ""wow they're pretty!"" Or ""wow they handsome!"" But not actually be attracted to them.   If someone says ""I will never date a person shorter than me that's gross"" most people would think they're a dick. If someone says ""I will never date a person of a different race that's gross"" most people would think they're a dick.   ",6

"I wouldn't necessarily say ""garbage"" but it presents an image of feminism by inference; Suggesting that feminism is about blaming others, absolving women of responsibility, and vilifying men. There's certainly a faction of the extremist side of feminism that can reflect that vantage point, however, we shouldn't paint the whole movement based on extremism.   While moderate feminism might not suggest that there's a ""war"" or women, it does acknowledge the very real dangers and prejudices women face on a daily basis. It's not wrong to highlight those dangers and look for solutions, including involving men in the solution since many of those dangers are perpetrated by their peers. Education and engagement is not the same as blame. Given that 68% of sexual assaults are never reported, the idea of ""empowerment"" is also central to the ideals of the movement. Empowerment simply means informing women that they have a choice (which sadly some women are ignorant of that fact) and educating them on how to better provide for their own health and safety. In the case of the picture it uses ""empowerment"" as if it were an negative or a condescension against women. Of course empowerment and feminism go beyond just aspects of sex and direct abuse but also issues of equality in job placement and compensation as well as general treatment, advancement, education, etc. Some people feel that discussing these issues is antithetical to overcoming them.

"Straight PvP is not even close to the DZ nor the games intentions.  First it's an RPG with shooter elements, secondly the DZ is unique on every level. It's PvE but with the option of PvP. The PvP option is for the loot that players have, this will probably come into play with the special events that will be taking place.   The only reason the DZ became a warzone in the beta is due to the amount of players in a small area and the lack of things to do, the final game won't be like this. The guardian interview with the creative director give a lot of insight on what the creative directors view is and a bit of what to expect.

"There's a two counterpoints I've got for you.  The first is that you are looking at income inequality. This is an issue that is not solved by redistributing wealth, but providing more opportunity for everyone to gain wealth while not further reducing capital going into the economy. The redistribution does not occur via taxing the rich and giving to the poor, but giving the poor opportunity to earn more and advance higher. Eliminate barriers to success, but don't erect more barriers by doing so.  Second (and much more succinctly), there's a vast difference between redistributing a little bit, as you said, and free college for everyone.",6

"I'm not condoning his behavior with her either, but I also don't think she's as blameless as people are making her out to be. Regardless of how toxic the relationship was, she still knowingly and consciously took actions that caused them to break up.  Or to reframe it in another way: Pretend I and a good friend go out drinking every Sunday. One day, his GF comes up to me and asks me if he really does go drinking with me every Sunday, or if he's been lying about that and he's really banging someone else on the side.  The fact that someone in this hypothetical scenario would ask me that is a huge sign their relationship is unhealthy and needs to end. People in healthy relationships don't really ask ""By the way, is your friend cheating on me?""  *However*, I would still be very fucked up if I lied and said ""No, we haven't hung out at all"", regardless of how stable their relationship is.

They're probably starting to see Sterak's gain popularity in Top, Jungle, and Support and are altering it so that it's only built against burst and not in every single situation.  I don't really argue either, personally. I'm seeing the item being built by many people in every single game.

You have medicare, but they pay premiums, and the amount for medicaid socialization still doesn't fill in that $900 billion dollar gap between the socialism that the rich and poor get.  Not to mention there are far few people that each get a huge share of that 1.3 trillion dollars while it's many people getting a tiny slice of the poors' welfare.

"From a talk at Tales of the Cocktail on eggs that I attended in 2010:   In terms of the health fears, it has been covered elsewhere in depth, but here are the highlights:  • Salmonella, if present, is exclusively on the outer shell.  • Frequency is one egg in every 20- to 40-thousand, or one egg per person every 84 years.  • It takes 3-5 weeks for this bacteria to develop so use fresh eggs.  • There is more risk if eggs are cracked and sit around before being used. This gives the bacteria time to grow in numbers (especially since the bacteria from the outside of the shell would come into contact with the energy-rich inside of the egg at this point). The danger is in the improper handling of food, not in the use of eggs per se.  • Salmonella targets the sick, pregnant, very elderly, and very young which are four groups who should not be drinking egg cocktails in the first place.  • Eggs have a lower incidence of Salmonella than lettuce (unsure if he meant bacteria in general or Salmonella specifically).  • 17.5% alcohol by volume kills Salmonella.

"I've been beating the drum for Cliff Branch for a few years now.  As for Lynn Swann, most people who think he doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame don't understand that he only played for nine seasons. People often compare him to Cliff Branch and Drew Pearson (and often try to paint him as vastly inferior to both), but while Swann doesn't have as many yards per game or per season as Branch or Pearson, he has more TDs per game and per season than both of them. This is especially true in the playoffs, where Swann has nine TDs in 16 playoff games, versus eight in 22 playoff games for Pearson, and five in 22 playoff games for Branch. Branch has more receiving yards per playoff game (58.6) than Swann does (56.7), but Swann has more receiving yards per playoff game than Pearson does (50.2).  In terms of superlatives, Cliff Branch led the NFL in receiving yards and TDs in 1974, and receiving TDs in 1976. Drew Pearson led the NFL in receiving yards in 1977. Lynn Swann led the NFL in punt return yards in 1974, and receiving TDs in 1975. Branch has four Pro Bowl appearances, three First-Team All-Pro selections, and a Second-Team All-Pro selection. Pearson has three Pro Bowl appearances, three First-Team All-Pro selections, and a second team All-Pro selection. Swann has three Pro Bowl appearances, a First-Team All-Pro selection, two Second-Team All-Pro selections, and the Super Bowl X MVP award. Furthermore, Jerry Rice is the only WR with more cumulative receiving yards and TDs in Super Bowl history than him.  Basically, I agree that Cliff Branch should be in the Hall of Fame, and Drew Pearson at least deserves some consideration for it, but there is plenty of justification for Lynn Swann being in, regardless of what anybody says.",6

"My dad got a little drunk a couple of months ago and told me that he isn't in love with my mom anymore. They've been married 30+ years. She still doesn't know and I don't have the heart to tell her.    Edit-- Holy shit, I didn't expect this many replies. Thank you everyone for your advice and sympathy. I know I'm not alone here, so I feel comfort in knowing others are going or have gone through something similar with their parents. My parents are very open about their relationship to me, even to the point where it's a little TMI sometimes. They DO love each other and both of them have told me separately that they couldn't picture themselves with anyone else. They've managed to figure out their own system where they like to do their own thing. They'll still spend time together and enjoy the others company. We're a close family so my sister and I are over at their house for dinner at least once a week.    I think the hardest thing for me, is that he told me right after my fiancé and I got engaged. They have always been the couple I've looked up to as marriage goals. I realize that we're completely different relationships and it's silly to compare, but growing up and admiring your parents' marriage definitely made me want to one day have what they have/had.    All in all-- it's none of my business. I love them both equally and I just want them to be happy. They're adults and they can figure it our on their own with my support. At first, I really wanted to tell my mom, but at this point, it's my job to let them do their thing.",2064

They have tons of signature stats that consistently reflect their grades, so saying they just throw out random numbers to fit their narrative is simply laughable. You can argue that their system is subjective, but their stats are as objective as you can get as they are cold hard stats. But you probably didn't even know they did anything other than player grades. Their 0-100 scale is literally just their standard player grades proportioned to a scale that is easier to understand and makes more sense to the normal reader.

"Eleven years ago, I was giving a ride to a guy I barely knew, but generally liked and enjoyed his company. For no reason we ever discerned, he took off his seat belt, opened his door, and jumped out of my car.  Anybody who says 35mph isn't fast has never seen what I've seen.  He got about as close to death that afternoon as I believe a person can be. I knew enough first aid to keep him going until the paramedics arrived. I was seventeen. In the span of thirty minutes, just about every piece of my childhood innocence was **gone**. I grew up right there.  He woke up from the coma five days later with no memory of his actions. And then I learned the hard way that people with traumatic brain injuries tend to change drastically: he got dark. The insurance companies and police prohibited me from directly contacting him, and so in the absence of communication he concluded that I was ashamed and guilty.  I became the target of death threats, stalking. I never had any hate for him - hell, I felt sorry for the guy - but it was a lot to carry around with me. And then his family rallied and sued me for a million bucks. Of course, I was totally innocent, and eventually had the case thrown out.  I moved away from home to escape the whole mess, and I'll never go back. I hope I never see him again, but I hope he's well.",10
"OP gets to make all those assertions how those dogs are harmless at no citation and I have to give you one? Talk about double standards.  Anyway, here goes (most of this courtesy of /u/ST8R):  &gt; You should be ""breedist."" Given the preponderance of evidence for physical and behavioral differences between breeds, it's foolish *not* to be ""breedist."" Is it ""breedist"" to prefer huskies over basset hounds for running the Iditarod? No. Is it ""breedist"" to treat pit bulls as riskier than the average dog when they *clearly* are? **No.** It’s *common sense.* &gt;  &gt; This [2011 University of Texas study](http://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Abstract/2011/04000/Mortality,_Mauling,_and_Maiming_by_Vicious_Dogs.23.aspx) found that attacks by pit bulls are associated with higher morbidity rates, higher hospital charges, and a higher risk of death than are attacks by other breeds of dogs. Its authors concluded that ""strict regulation of pit bulls may substantially reduce the U.S. mortality rates related to dog bites."" &gt;  &gt; And [this 2011 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235708) focusing on dog attacks on children found that the more severe injuries involved pit bulls and Rottweilers. &gt;  &gt; [This five-year review at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia]( http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2009/08000/Pediatric_Dog_Bite_Injuries__A_5_Year_Review_of.28.aspx) found that pit bulls were involved in over half of the 551 dog bite injuries treated in its emergency room.  &gt;  &gt; Another [nine-year retrospective review conducted at two children’s hospitals](http://aaps1921.org/abstracts/2008/P13.cgi) found that 57 percent of attacks involved pit bulls or rottweilers.  &gt;  &gt; In [this study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/88/1/55.short), 94 percent of pit bull attacks were said to be unprovoked versus 43 percent for other dogs. &gt;  &gt; In recent years, pit bulls have killed more Americans than [all other breeds combined.](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-fatality-citations.php) &gt;  &gt; Very little is known about how many *animals* die as a result of pit bull attacks. But [this estimate](http://www.animals24-7.org/2015/01/27/how-many-other-animals-did-pit-bulls-kill-in-2014/) concluded that pit bulls were involved in about 60 percent of the reported fatal dog-on-animal attacks in the U.S. over the past two years. &gt;  &gt; This [German study](http://www.azs.no/artikler/art_agressive.pdf) found that five out of the eight fatal dog-on-dog attacks recorded for the study involved pit bull-type dogs, a finding the authors called “remarkable.” &gt;  &gt; And [this U.K. study]( http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/166/25/778.abstract) found that in dog-on-dog attacks where guide dogs were injured, bully breeds were the most common attackers and that the majority of injuries to people occurred in attacks involving a bully breed.  &gt;  &gt; David Billmire, professor and director of the Division of Craniofacial and Pediatric Plastic Surgery at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, [recently wrote this about pit bulls]( http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2014/06/29/doctor-says-ban-pit-bulls/11709481/): &gt;  &gt; &gt; “I can categorically tell you that the problems associated with dog bites are indeed breed-specific. When I started my career, the most common dog-bite injuries were from German shepherds and occasionally retrievers. These injuries were almost always provoked, such as food-related or stepping on the dog, and in almost every instance, the dog reacted with a single snap and release – essentially a warning shot. There were no pack attacks. &gt; Starting about 25 years ago, my colleagues and I started to see disturbingly different types of injuries. Instead of a warning bite, we saw wounds where the flesh was torn from the victim. There were multiple bite wounds covering many different anatomical sites. The attacks were generally unprovoked, persistent and often involved more than one dog. In every instance the dog involved was a pit bull or a pit bull mix.” &gt;  &gt; Pit bulls are [leading official dog attack reports across the U.S]( http://blog.dogsbite.org/2009/07/pit-bulls-lead-bite-counts-across-us.html). In my city, they're out-attacking labradors by eight to one, and that's after taking population into account. Pit bulls make up well over half of the dogs on Minneapolis' [interactive dangerous dog map](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/animals/dangerous/dangerous-dogs) which shows photos of the dogs in addition to breed descriptions (thus putting a nice fat hole into the whole ""most pit bulls are misidentified labs"" baloney). &gt;  &gt; That’s by no means an exhaustive list, but it’s compelling evidence that you *should* be concerned about pit bulls and you *should* carry some means of defending yourself (lethally, if need be). And you should speak out about what happened to you and the impact it’s had on your life. We should all demand that various interest groups start representing pit bulls and their associated risks honestly instead of drowning the public in [ridiculous propaganda.]( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-anthony-cooper/children-need-pit-bulls_b_5393410.html) &gt;  &gt; That said, it's also good to put the risk in perspective. Yes, pit bulls are risky. Yes, they're particularly risky toward other dogs. Yes, there's a reason most insurers won't touch them with a ten foot pole. Yes, pit bulls kill a certain number of people and pets every year and that number is greater than for any other breed.  &gt;  &gt; However, you're far more likely to be injured or killed while driving your dog to the park than you are to be injured by a pit bull once you get there. Also, remember that these statistics are a function of both risk and popularity. Pit bulls do top the charts, but that does not necessarily make them the most dangerous kind of dog. I can think of several other types of dog (presa canario, fila brasileiro, etc.) that, were they as common as pit bulls, would likely be responsible for an even greater number of attacks. &gt;  &gt; So do what I do. Recognize that pit bulls pose a real hazard to you and carry a reliable means of defending yourself, but don't get so hung up on pit bulls that you fail to think about all the other risks in your life.",8

"If Lue doesn't tear them a new asshole after this inexcusable loss, then the firing was all for naught.  I'm pro-Lue, but this kind of effort stuff is the one thing he absolutely MUST deliver on.  If you throw out the question of whether or not he is an adequate strategist compared to Blatt, the whole point was that he would be able to mentally reach his apathetic star players.  The last two games have shown us this is not the case.    We've seen better defensive effort from Love, and fewer ISOs from LeBron, but WORSE defensive effort from LeBron and MORE ISOs from Kyrie.  There was one point mid way through the fourth, after Kyrie dribbled through all 5 defenders with minimal success, wasting all but about 6 seconds on the shot clock.  Lue then called a time out.  I thought to myself, ""yes, he's finally intervening"".  After the timeout, Kyrie AGAIN dribbled by himself as if there were no such thing as teammates or passing, then took and awful contested shot, which he of course clanked.  What the fuck was the point of that timeout?    The bottom line is that the Cavs have real problems stemming from LeBron and Kyrie not playing smart basketball.  Lue has gotten Kevin involved better, and to his credit Love has responded with better effort on d.  But the LeBron and Kyrie problems have not been resolved and that is concerning.  Lue better chew them out over this, or I don't see the point of making the change.  Rant over.",11

So your fiance's parents want him to move in with you when you move out. Is your boyfriend under the impression that he's moving out with you?

"You observe a modified Passover diet. After sunset you're allowed to eat only the foods that appear at a traditional Seder: hard boiled eggs, horseradish, parsley dipped in saltwater, beets or lamb, unleavened bread, and a delicious apple/cinnamon/walnut/honey/wine tapenade called charoset. No alcohol other than wine. During the daytime you subsist on salt water and a vitamin/mineral cocktail known colloquially in diet circles as manna. This includes vitamins B12, C, D, and CoQ10.

"Yes. This. Me. My boyfriend tells me all of the time that I'm not depressed and I need to stop. I can't talk to him about how I feel because he tells me to ""knock it off"".  I feel like I don't deserve to be depressed because it's all based around my appearance. I'm not ugly. But I judge myself so harshly. I hate waking up because I hate having to stare at myself in the mirror trying to fix the flaws. If I try to talk to people about this, they think I'm vain but don't understand that I'm deeply saddened by the way I look or wish I could run away to a place with no mirrors. Like a secluded island. But everything else about my life is comfortable. Great job, great boyfriend (except for talking about my depression), comfortable living.   This is why I don't feel like I have the right to feel depressed. I have my health for the most part. I have so much that other people don't. But I cry every night and feel sick about how I look.

" &gt;good, thats his job, represent his constituents not his church.  The problem is, the church leaders have a habit of threatening LDS politicians when they don't also push the same agenda as the church.    Take for example Mitt Romney's father, Governor George Romney, and his backing of the civil rights movement in light of the LDS church's view on blacks at that time.   Delbert Stapley, an apostle in the church sent the following to him.  https://archive.org/details/DelbertStapleyLetter &gt;**When I reflect upon the Prophet's statements and remember what happened to three of our nation's presidents who were very  active in the Negro cause, I am sobered by their demise.**   They went contrary to the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith- unwittingly, no doubt, but nevertheless, the prophecy of Joseph  Smith, """" those who are determined to pursue a course, which shows an opposition, and a feverish restlessness against the decrees of the Lord, will learn, when perhaps it is too late for their own good, that God can do His own work, without the aid of those who are not dictated by His counsel,"" has and will continue to be fulfilled.  ...     &gt;In this respect, let me give you a personal experience. A friend of mine in Arizona— not a Church member—a great champion of the colored race—came to me after my call into the Twelve, and acknowledged President McKay to be a Prophet of God.   He wanted me to ask President McKay to inquire of the Lord to see if the Lord would not lift the curse from the colored race and give them the privileges of the Priesthood. I explained to him that the Lord had placed the curse upon the Negro, which denied him the Priesthood; therefore, it was the Lord's responsibility- -not man's— to change His decision.   **This friend of mine met a very tragic end by drowning.**  ...  &gt;Now, **don't think I am against the Negro people, because I have several in my employ.**   We must understand and recognize their status and then, accordingly, provide for them. I just don't think we can get around the Lord's position in relation to the Negro without punishment for our acts; going contrary to that which He has revealed. The Lord will not permit His purposes to be frustrated by man.    He also mentions a pamphlet called ""Mormonism and the Negro"". A vile publication that put into words the LDS doctrine that blacks are cursed due to Cain's murderous act and that the spirits inhabiting those bodies were ""lukewarm"" in a ""war in heaven"" prior to this life when Satan allegedly took 1/3 of god's spirit children with him.   This can be read here, https://archive.org/details/MormonismAndTheNegro, if you wish to waste some time in your life. I'd recommend it only to those seriously wanting a history of the racial doctrine in the church. It has no other value.   ",67

During the International Women's Year in 1975 Icelandic women attracted great attention when they organized a general strike to show how important women's undervalued work was. 90 per cent of the Icelandic women went on strike. And at the presidential election in 1980 the women's movement focused on getting a woman. After much persuasion Vigdís accepted to run against three male candidates. She was the first woman in the world to be elected as head of state in a democratic election, despite being a divorced single mother. She was narrowly elected, with 33.6 percent of the national vote, while her nearest rival got 32.1 percent. She became very popular and was subsequently reelected three times, unopposed in 1984, with 92 percent of the votes against another woman in 1988 and unopposed in 1992. In 1996 she did not run for election."" wikipedia  The only effortless (I mean - without needing a party to back her) so far I have found is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia  ",7

"*weeaboos wobble but they don't fall down*  ---- Potential background check issue for teaching in S. Korea.  &gt;So I have seen some form of this question asked a bazillion times on many different forums, and feel kind of like an asshat for asking it. But, after months of fretting over it I've decided to suck it up and ask for insight.  &gt; &gt;Background checks for teaching in South Korea (I know...I know). I know most of the answers are along the lines of: If anything pops on your background you're up the creek without a paddle. I have looked everywhere for someone in my situation and haven't found anything like mine. Most posts are from people complaining that their DUI or possession charge is stopping them. I, however, am afraid I will have something pop from when I was 21 (almost 10 years ago), and it's a littering charge. Seriously. I was ticketed for 'littering on government property' because I threw a cigarette butt out the window of my car. I think the judge was trying to make an example out of me, because it IS a problem and people shouldn't do it (I sucked at 21). Long story short he fined me $200 and slapped me a misdemeanor. It has shown up on background checks for jobs. I wasn't arrested or fingerprinted, but I got the charge. I have never had any run in with the law previous to that or after. I am about to graduate with my second BA in Linguistics with in class TEFL experience...and I speak conversational Korean. My soul hurts thinking my awesome credentials are trumped by a haunting cigarette butt. &gt; &gt;I have read that it's up to the immigration officer handling your case, and I have also heard that no matter what the charge you're screwed. I went ahead and mailed in the forms to run my own FBI check to see if it shows up (on the off chance somehow it magically doesn't) but am just trying to prepare myself for the probable case that it does pop.  &gt; &gt;TL;dr - I was charged with a misdemeanor 10 years ago for throwing a cigarette butt out of my car window (aka littering). Does that mean S. Korea will never want to have anything to do with me? Should I start learning Japanese?   ----  ^(send feedback/suggestions to /u/Aurigarion)",6

The vibe was that they would have preferred him just stop coming altogether. I was a new elder, but I couldn't help but speak up.   I asked why we couldn't arrange to help him clean up his home and his person somehow. The other elders answer? ""We wouldn't want to subject the sisters to the mess at his home.""  Why were we assuming sisters would have to be the ones to do the cleaning?  Finally it was decided that someone would anonymously call ~~suicidal~~ social services on him.  Fucked up.

"There's two problems with this argument:  Firstly, how do we assess what is done with the well-being of the child in mind? Neither of your examples work here: almost all children raised to be religious are raised as such for their own well-being (i.e. in order to not be condemned in some way, in order to be 'saved', to provide a moral education, to allow them to participate in society etc.). Similarly, the feminist example could also very easily be argued to be in the child's best interest and for their well-being (i.e. it improves their 'ethical well-being'/makes them a better person, it teaches them certain values, it makes them more personable and respectful etc.)  Secondly, you haven't actually provided an argument as to *why* this is immoral, you simply state that it is. Your conclusion is essentially that it's immoral to raise your child to be moral for morality's sake, which initially sounds absurd, so you're really going to need to provide a good argument for that.",7

Essentially, it would be ""If you thought I was a bad leader then, why did you vote for me?"" and then ""I clearly regret my decision which is why I am running against you now"".

"I actually found I didn't need to know much of anything as a tank either. In many cases, I actually needed to know less than the healer/dps.  The main thing that you need to know when getting into a group is how general tanking is done. How to pull groups, how to face the mobs/boss, how to hold enmity on groups effectively, and how to use your defensive cooldowns are all necessary for a beginner tank.   But you don't really need to know much past that, or at least any more than what DPS need to know. The majority of dungeon bosses includes, ""Stand the boss here and hit it, try to not stand in stuff."" Hell take a look at Sastasha, the first final boss you face the tank doesn't have to do anything at all while the healer/dps have to respond to the mechanic.   With the more complicated dungeon bosses that require you to respond to more mechanics, dps have to know all that stuff too anyway so idk. Sure you could get fancy with it and know all of those things, but if you go into it blind you aren't going to die to anything if your healer is awake (or if they are a SCH, even if they aren't).  Tanking is scary to a new player not because it's that much more intensive, but because every fight starts on their lead so they are put into a leadership position whether they like it or not. You also bear the weight of knowing that if you die, the party will likely wipe (at least in dungeons over level 30, and even then most smaller mobs can be healed through, so you have that on your shoulders as well. It's a lot of responsibility for someone who is still learning how the game is played and what is expected of you, whereas with dps or something you are following the lead of someone else inherently.",6

"&gt;Which also kind of suggests the less obvious: Don't scoop until you're actually dead.   Another good one is even if you have no or very few outs, consider of the game going longer hurts them or you more before deciding to scoop.    For example you're playing burn vs miracles.  You win game one, and they get a pretty hard lock on you game 2.  There's 25 minutes left.  Don't scoop!  Make them kill you and leave little time left.  If you win that game it's usually a quick one, and if you lose its usually a long one.  So if you go into game 3 with 5 minutes left you're very unlikely to lose, but you have a good shot of winning.    In a similar vein if you're playing a deck like lands that can combo out quickly or play control note the time on the clock when you make mulligan decisions.  If there's 5 minutes left you don't want a grindy hand, you need to combo quickly.  ",9

Consider the [tests summarized](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1360.short) by Herrmann and colleagues from the Max Planck institute of evolutionary anthropology: They compared grown-up chimps on a battery of tests with human children. These test batteries have the advantage to demonstrate precisely where we're better (or not).  Grown-up chimps do as good as 2.5 year-old children when it comes to causal understanding (ie. what you can expect things to do). But ""we"" defeat chimps when it comes to social understanding. That gap grows larger the older humans get.  This kind of social intelligence is different to the ability measured by an IQ test. After all, ""we"" survived for at least 200,000 years without maths or science. You can do fine with an IQ of, say, 70 or 80 from an evolutionary point of view, provided you have sufficient social intelligence.  Consequently, women's brains didn't evolve to value analytical intelligence. Just like men, they run around with a brain mostly adapted to the Pleistocene. ",12

"I think that CG was ineffective because she should have explored plea negotiations.    I think that before the first trial, a good attorney might have negotiated a plea to 2nd degree murder with a 15 year sentence.  I think that after the mistrial was declared mid-way through the first trial, a good attorney might have negotiated a plea to manslaughter.  Mistrials are optimum times for negotiating deals.   I don't believe that Adnan asked her for a deal; I think that is simply a self-serving lie. (One which I would expect any convict to tell if that was the only chance at freedom).  But I think that all attorneys owe their clients a duty to explore the possibility of a negotiated plea and to advise their client of all options, whether or not their client wants that -- and it is especially unconscionable to have failed to do that when representing a 17 year old facing a potential life sentence   If she had been able to negotiate a deal for a fixed term, Adnan would probably have completed his sentence and have been released by now.",15

"Welcome!  /u/vietbond already identified your bullion coin for you.    There's quite literally an entire world of coins that might interest you, going back a few thousand years.  They range from ""business strikes"", which are regular coins that might enter circulation, to "" proofs"", think proof of concept or proofing a photo, limited runs of coins, some never touched by human hands, sealed in plastic.  There are also coins that were never legal tender:  patterns, coins that were distributed as proposals for upcoming coins that were never approved, tokens, and medallions, which can be issued for anything from festivals to holidays.  There are themed coins -- got a favorite animal or hobby?  There are commemorative coins.  There are coins that have precious jewels in them.  There are coins that push the limit of how a coin is shaped (like little domes.)  There are coins made of gold, silver, copper, nickel, aluminum, manganese, platinum, bronze, brass, tin, and palladium.  There are pattern plastic coins.  Sooner or later every nation that wants to remain a nation tries to make coins.  You can collect coins from pocket change, or buy proof coins from the mid-1800's.  You can search rolled coins (for silver and older varieties) purchased at face value from your local bank, see /r/crh.  You can collect your nation's coins, the coins of another country, or coins from every country.  You can save pennies, or spend thousands of dollars.  It can fill the occasional hour, or it can fill entire weekends.  I almost forgot error coins.  These are coins that were misstruck and made it past inspection out into the world.  I really enjoy error coins.  They're not *supposed* to happen and mints tend to destroy them, so they tend to be rare.  They can be found in circulation.  For me it's the thrill of discovery when I find something new or get a good deal.  I also love coin history.  Check out HTTPS://www.pcgscoinfacts.com, HTTPS://www.ngccoin.com, and HTTPS://www.anacs.com for some inspiration. :)  We have lots of different areas of interest here on /r/coins, and I find my fellow members to be an incredible resource for education, information, and sometimes -- more coins.

Does it mean Jensen doesn't have asshole fans? No. Does it mean MISHA doesn't have asshole fans? NO. One of my least favorite people in this fandom is a massive Misha fan and it *drives* her jerkiness.

It is hard to understand it if you have not experienced it (no disrespect), but anxiety, depression, psychosis, there are so many of these problems and I empathise so much with people dealing with them and dealing with it in socially accepted ways.  It is hard to reach a lot of people in society, people that slip between the cracks, alone, scared to call a number, no family, no friends. The ones that do get help are either joining an institution or have made such a scene they clearly need help.  My dealings with it working as a support worker these past 10 years has shown me, people need people, they need their private space and the need to be part of a community, psychosis if drug induced, its because of boredom, social norm's and routine. We've lost something in this age, we've become separated and I can't tell you the amount of people that say 'I hate people'.   The worst thing about all of it is, how much I'm allowed to do, its not about the money, its about helping people feel part of something, that they are worth something and mean something.

But the same case should be made for not giving the right of voting to men who didn't serve at least a few years in the military.  In the United States, at least, the military is revered. The silver lining is that Americans still have guns which is at least a potential check on big brother and any budding Islamic invasion. Europe is fucked because they gave up all of their powers to government and now their governments are dismantling them.  Europe's best chance at a reset is a few targeted assassinations of leftists.

Then you will know how it will feel like instead of reading numbers online.   Edit: If you have no idea what to buy, buy a Hurricane 3 Neo ($15) and the cheapest rubber with Tensor ($30-35). Those two rubbers are vastly different and you will get a feel for what aspects of each rubber you like. Try to flip it around as well and play with the rubber on the other side. Then when you play with other people's rackets, you can get an understanding of how different their racket is compared to yours. Is it faster? Is it spinnier? Does it have better control? Is it heavier? ",9

"&gt; What Classic wants is a 2MB HF... and SegWit either integrated with the HF, or put forward as a HF later. Thus, it's not a compromise, even if it's presented as one.  Classic, as it has been coded and deployed, is only an increase in 2 MB. This **necessarily** means that a segwit would need to be deployed as a soft fork or hard fork after the 2 MB hard fork.  The compromise for Classic is that they would stop the attempted hard fork now, delaying it until you have a unified hard fork attempt in cooperation with Core, incorporating the 2 MB increase with segwit.  &gt; A SF could be deployed by ~May 2016 (~3 months), while a HF would need 9-12 months to be safely deployed.  9-12 month hard fork deployment of a 2 MB + segwit packaged deal is way too generous, especially if you have Core and Classic uniting behind the effort. Miners, exchanges, wallet providers and developers are not going to wake up tomorrow one morning and be suddenly surprised by such a hard fork.  Also your estimation of segwit's impact on relieving the transaction capacity in such a short time **is a guess**. Besides, the purpose of segwit is not to primarily relieve transaction capacity, it is to solve tx malleability and deploy other awesome features we all would like to see.   An increase in the block size is a direct and immediate increase in the transaction capacity once it is rolled-out. Adam Back himself suggested it in August **last year**. ",8

It's important for **him** to feel like it's a wedding and obviously some of the stuff that matters to him for a wedding to have, but if he gets any of those things he also gets the added bonus of you making *very clear* how much you hate it.

"The facts:  **YOU COME FIRST**  You only get this one life and you are 1000% fully entitled to live your best and healthiest life. NEVER think otherwise. YOU are a wonderful, unique soul and you deserve your life and your dreams.  **95% of women who choose to terminate DO NOT regret their choice.**   Also:  * NATURE aborts somewhere around 20% of pregnancies after the woman knows about it. * Likely, another 20% end naturally before a woman even knows she's pregnant. * Another 20% of pregnancies end in chosen terminations.  So yes, you are reading that right. 50-60% of pregnancies NEVER result in a child being born by either nature or choice.  You absolutely 100% do NOT need to think of yourself as a ""bad person"" for doing what nature and many, many other women do.  You would not judge nature or another woman for making this choice in the same situation -- so DO NOT EVER judge yourself negatively.   Do not buy into a bunch of hype from asshole politicians about abortion when the TRUTH is that 95% of women do not regret.  The politicians want you to believe otherwise but it is nothing but bullshit.  Get healthy, live your life.   Maybe you have a child later, or maybe you do not, or maybe you adopt or whatever... but if you ruin your health now, you will not have the chance to either live your full life or be a healthy parent, whichever you choose in the future.

"There are also some historical reasons why you can't find a largish place to live, especially if you're from a large European city. Melbourne boomed in the 1880's, and really started building multi-story buildings from that point onwards.  In the CBD, they were usually designed to be offices, not apartments, because there was such a lot of land close by for houses.   In 1889, at the end of the boom, there were approx. 450K people in Melbourne.  At the same time, there would have been approx 2.4 million people in Paris, for example.  There are a few 'mansion flats' from the 1910 - 1920 period, but not usually in the CBD.  I'm currently living in one at the edge of the city, built in the 1930's.  We have 70sqm of space, for a one bedroom apartment.   I previously lived in a flat in Europe that had (among other things) a maid's room, which would have been unthinkable in Australia - if you had enough money for a maid, you would have lived in a house.  We also spent a lot of time in the 60's and 70's knocking down fantastic old buildings, instead of converting them to living space.  We simply don't have comparable physical historical stock, compounded by the fact that we also don't have a historical trend of apartment living with children/multi-families.",7

"I would guess it has to do with [plate tectonics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg). For example, Hawaii is a volcanic *island* because it is in the middle of the Pacific Plate. Similarly, Greenland is an island because it is part of the North American Plate. On the other hand, we call Australia a *continent* rather than an island because it is a dominant land mass that alone occupies most of the Australian Plate.  Edit: Unlike other definitions, this also explains why we define Eurasia and Africa (alternatively, North America and South America, though you could argue the Panama Canal separates them) as two different continents, despite being connected by land.  Edit 2: The definition above does not explain why India is not it's own continent. I give the revised definition:  A land mass is considered a **continent** if:  1) Any two points can be connected by a path on land  2) It is completely surrounded by water  3) If it is separated among tectonic plate components, then:  * Each piece is the largest land mass in its respective tectonic plate * The faults separating the pieces are convergent ",23

The worst dialogue that I've seen is one that actually draws a solid line between 12-tone/serialist music and Germany's 1930s/40s fascism (i.e. that, through his radical formal experiments, a composer like Schoenberg was *really* trying to lay the groundwork for some unnatural 'master race' of new composers, or some shit...), a narrative that ultimately characterizes Britain's and America's heavily marketed rock/pop music (and the half-assed post-modern classical music that limply took inspiration from rock/pop) from the 1950s onward as some massive liberating force. That latter characterization reminds me a lot of Reddit's firmly-supply-side dispositions towards things like movies and games (e.g. that the whole GG non-troversy was primarily aimed at small, indie publishers instead of triple-A publishers was very telling).",8

It's because we're not discussing death or cirrhosis or myocardial infarctions here, an end-outcome that's clinically obvious. We're discussing subtle changes in cognition/memory.

There was a chicken coop and at my young age, I was very fascinated by chickens. If I weren’t a squirrelkin, I’d probably be a chickenkin. Just to put into perspective how much I love chickens. So anyway, we were at the farm, and this guy just came up and picked up the chicken. He seemed to touch the chicken in inappropriate ways. And an egg fell out. And then the chicken died a little while later. As I mentioned before, this may have been a dream, but it was still very real for me.

"Already addressed the asteroid revenue. The moon's value lies primarily in the cost savings associated with the asteroid revenue.   In regards to the New World - there was still plenty of timber in early colonization efforts and wasn't a large driving force, nor was farmland. Gold was largely proven to be a failed venture after the 16th century Spanish push failed to meet quotas. All those cited economies were things developed after initial  colonization numbers had gone through. One could make an argument for their validity in 18th century immigration/colonization, but that would be an inappropriate comparison for what we're talking about.   There are stated economic benefits to what we can get on asteroids and the moon. If one can master those, there is no reason one can't pursue Mars colonization for a variety of sociocultural factors supported by dropping costs associated with space travel secondary to gains made in technology with operating asteroid mining ventures and moon-based logistics.

"Why do you keep posting crackpottery?  And why does it seem that physics crackpots are disproportionately engineers?  Anyway, ""The General Science Journal"", isn't a reputable, or peer-reviewed journal, much less a physics journal.  The paper itself has zero merit:  &gt;This eliminates the controversy that surrounds the experiments performed with this device showing positive results that seemingly violate the Newton’s third law of action and reaction  First of all, among real, reputable physicists, there is no controversy since no such thing has been shown.  Second of all, NASA has not tried to do anything with this, as he suggests in his introductions.  It is two cranks who happen to be working at Eagleworks.  &gt;The author of this paper has established in previous publications(Hynecek, 2013a) and in several others that the universe we are living in is finite in size and filled with a material entity called Dark Matter (DM)  So he cites his previous crackpot work and then implies that he was one of the people who established the existence of dark matter.  No.  &gt;This DM supports the propagation of light as transversal electromagnetic (EM) waves and the propagation of gravity as the longitudinal waves  More stupidity.  No physicist who's taken even an undergraduate particle class thinks dark matter, whatever the model, interacts electromagnetically.  And gravitational waves are [transverse](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_details.html) and have never been linked to dark matter.  We don't even know what dark matter is.  &gt; The DM model of the universe thus assumes that the DM is deformable and that both the electr omagnetic field and the gravitational field are essentially the deformations of this DM  This makes zero sense, and doesn't even attempt to use any field theory to describe this (probably because he doesn't know any).  &gt;It is thus necessary to somehow convert or generate from the transversal EM field the longitudinal EM field that would couple to gravitational waves.  He must be some sort of super-genius to have figured out how to unify gravity and electromagnetism before the hundreds (or thousands) of very qualified physicists who tried (and failed) before him. /s  He then claims he can generate gravitons with some undergraduate-level optical setup.  You cannot.  This is completely silly and unjustified.  He cites his own previous paper where he claims equation (1) is something he derived but in actuality it has been [known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model#Cosmic_expansion_history) to cosmologists for a while.  He claims to have derived it, but copied it is more likely, and he just interprets the rho factor as only relating to dark matter.  He goes on with some wrong ideas, trying to derive a formula for force with an incorrect understanding of physics, trying to link electromagnetism with dark matter and gravitons.   As an example of some of this garbage, he's saying he claims gravitons have spin zero, whenever every reputable physicist hypothesizes they are spin-2 (B-mode polarization/gravitational waves are tensor modes so thinking they are spin-2 makes sense; if there are experts around they can elaborate or correct).  I'm not even going to bother with the rest.  The is textbook crackpot physics.  **OP, I urge you to stop searching Google for people who take the emdrive seriously and derive crank theories about it.  You are clearly not a physicist and cannot see that what you post or propose is either wrong, or irrelevant.  You're just confusing yourself and others.**",35

"Roosh doesn't need defending. He deliberately provoked this situation to further his brand.  That said, the response to his provocation deserves examination. He didn't describe these events as 'pro-rape', but as events for men to meet up and discuss the state of masculinity.  The media has painted the events as 'pro-rape' because they are not fact checking or doing any serious research into the man himself or his views. It's an example of outrage journalism directed at a 'safe' target.  Now Roosh has deliberately manipulated the outrage machine himself for his own ends, but it bears observing the outcome for future events. When the outrage journalism machine is directed and focused for long enough, sensitive readers are whipped into a state of frenzy where the normal rule of law becomes tenuous. Threats of violence are accepted. Doxxing is accepted (Anonymous is threatening the Roosh forum's membership list). Suspension of freedom of assembly is accepted (in Western Australia, the Minister for Police implied that attendees would be 'marked', presumably placed on a watch list.) Senior political figures have denounced the meetups, seemingly condoning the public response.  This is what happens today in the West if you have an ideology or viewpoint that the general public disagrees with. People will not do any investigation, but will gladly focus their anger on the media's target of the '2 minute hate'.  In theory, you have freedom of speech and assembly, but in practice this event shows how easily those things can effectively vanish if you are painted as a reader of the wrong website.  Edit: It should be noted that the meetups are for the readership of the tabloid ReturnofKings website to discuss the state of masculinity. It would be the equivalent of the Jezebel readership meeting up worldwide and discussing feminst issues, except with the site being run by a modern Gloria Steinman with more experience in media manipulation.",8

"Among so many beloved episodes, this remains my number one favorite episode of TNG.  It was a perfect storm of script and performance, sets and sound design. Its signature song [is beloved to this day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHo2ZJ2vzM0). It was also an interesting notion; could a man seem to live an entire life in just moments? A lot of viewers may not realize it but the moment he picked up that flute in his quarters and played it, the show was taking the stance that he did indeed live that entire life. Again, it's a testament to the force that is Captain Picard that he once again gets to keep his command despite such a life-changing experience.   There were some incredible moments in this episode. I believed Helen and Batai so much, the actors were so genuine and projected so much warmth. I loved the awkward first discussion with Helene as Picard nervously ate his soup and so believably bowed out of coming to bed. The moment he realizes what's been going on, when he sees Helene and Batai, young again, I choke up every time. Life is a sublime experience. People move in and out of our lives every day but some, when they pass, leave you wishing forever to hear just one more word, feel one more touch. I always wish for those stories to be true, that in your final moments you see those whom you've loved and lost come for you. This evocative moment is particularly powerful that way and helped add an extra emotional layer to the scene.  But maybe it was a simple moment in the denouement that has stayed with me ever since first seeing this episode. A simple gesture, portrayed with purity and genuine innocence; [the moment Picard held that flute to his chest with all his might](https://youtu.be/IjCxl9JL6Ug?t=1m15s). It makes me tear up every time I see it. He did have a love, a life, a family -and they were forever out of reach now. In that moment, he gathered them all to his heart and just missed them with all his might. It's a testament to the actors, director and the writers that they could so emotionally invest the audience like that in 44 minutes. It really deserved an emmy.  Trivia time, as always! Picard's son, Batai, was played by Patrick's real life son Daniel who went bald just as young as his father. He had to jump through flaming hoops to get the part. He also had to wear a very believable toupee in his first scenes but you get to see his real bald head in the final sequence and boy, that apple did not fall from the tree hehe.  I loved this episode,  [and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZaFNFyuv2w). It speaks to a time when Star Trek didn't have to be about explosions or action -but the fragility of the human experience. ",9

"People keep saying this, but let's get real, there's no fucking way that this isn't gonna Obama's nomination. He's got almost a year left in office. It would be MASSIVELY controversial to block a confirmation THAT long.  What's likely going to happen is that Obama will nominate someone moderate-left like Srinivasan who has credentials through the roof. That will back the GOP into a corner where they will run the risk of alienating large swaths of the moderate voters in the Presidential elections if they try to block someone so qualified and generally agreeable.   If they get stubborn and take their obstructionism to new heights, they will likely get slaughtered in the election. And if they confirm, then the most conservative seat in SCOTUS will be replaced by a moderate-leftist. Either way, it's a huge win-win for the Democrats.

But it does kind of bother me that the Merch Monday megathread doesn't really get a lot of traffic, with a good handful people actually posting legitimate, official merchandise (some people post images that may barely get 100 views). Yet, there are a handful of ""subtle/low key merchandise"" threads that get far more attention (200+ upvotes) with links to website with sellers that thrive off bootleg and unlicensed merchandise (Redbubble, etsy, unlicensed Amazon/eBay sellers) and through circumventing copyright rules by offering designs for a limited time and taking advantage of Japanese companies not focusing on international licensing (similar to unofficial downloaded/streaming anime). Occasionally, you'll even see a design that is officially being sold by licensed manufacturers bootlegged on one of the previously mentioned sites.

I don't believe the weaker girl would have made this plan, were it not for the other girl's influence.   I think it's possible for relatively mentally healthy people to induce a kind of psychosis in each other by feeding off a single wish or idea in an extreme way until they actually believe it, like what happened at witch trials int he past, or the Satanic Panic of the 80's, just restricted to two people.

"First down: A team has reached a net gain of 10 yards, and their tries reset.  SCORING: Touchdowns: when one team reached the end of the field they are trying to. This scores them 6 points.   After the touchdowns 6 points are awarded, the team may attempt to get into the ""end zone"" one more time this time from 5 yards out (I think it's 5). If they do this they get 2 points. OR They may kick the ball through the yellow uprights. If they succeed they get 1 more point.  Field goal: A team does not make it to the end of the field but makes it close. They use their fourth try (A.K.A: ""down"") to kick the ball through the yellow uprights. If they succeed, the team is awarded 3 points.",43

"Here here.  Did the Taken just up and disappear? Did the Fallen forget they wanted to sack the city and ""reclaim"" the Traveler? Are the Vex on vacation?  I think this issue needs to be addressed in two meaningful ways:  * The persistent PvE mode that echos HALO's Firefight mode that everyone clearly wants. * PvE events reminiscent of the original Queen's Wrath that mix up the Live Team's events.  There is one piece of the Destiny universe that gives me hope for this direction though: The Cabal  We already know the Cabal have built their entire social structure on duty and victory. Soldiers who leave for war are disowned by the Emperor until they claim victory. We have kicked their teeth in time and time again. Reading the *Cabal Champions* card and the *Outbound Signal* card it seems pretty clear that we will need to deal with an invasion in force from the Cabal Empire sooner rather than later.  This kind of plot point would play very well for the kind of PvE mode we've been asking for. The Cabal launching a full scale offensive against our solar system allows for incursions on every planet as well as some new locations possibly. Specific director locations or random public events, either would work.  Personally I'd like to see something like Battlefield's Conquest mode with multiple fireteams working together to take strategic points on the map and pushing the invasion force back section by section before (the timer runs out) large scale reinforcements arrive and nuke the battlefield.  Well, we all have our visions for how this can be executed, I just can't wait for Bungie to share theirs.",15

"When students go to a CC and then transfer to a 4-year, it reduces the money a 4-year makes off that student. Sure they fill a dorm, but for less time for a student. This puts downward pressure on tuition because a college has to work harder to fill tuition quotas each year. Bringing in a freshman vs bringing in a junior is 2 years sooner a college has to find another student.  This means that you put, theoretically, a 4-year in competition with CCs. Since CC costs are lower, that's where the downward pressure comes from.  One of the reasons why students go to CC then transfer is to save on overall degree costs. If you make CC free, then you put even more downward pressure on 4-years.",11

"No one ever talks about all the trash, urine and feces left behind by homeless people that the city has to pay people to clean up. This morning there was a large pile of trash in front of the store I work at. Other places I've worked at downtown all have similar problems. I don't mind cleaning up when I'm paid to work at said store, but the amount of trash left behind is a problem. Our neighbor next door said they have to clean up human feces all the time. Today a homeless man walked in a stole some stuff from the shop, and we had to call non-emergency. He was clearly mentally ill so it was sad, but at the same time something needs to be done. We can't invite homeless people to sleep on the streets if they can't even clean up after themselves. There are plenty public garbage cans for said trash. Go to any other neighboring city and I promise you they won't have the amount of trash and homeless people in the streets. Violence is also a huge one. Everyone is capable of being violent, homeless or not, but homelessness in itself can turn a person sick, desperate and mentally ill. It's just not right.

"Can you source this? I don't doubt you -- I'd just like to see the text of the actual executive order (I'm just having trouble finding it). I do know that Obama has been talking about executive action on guns for a while.  You actually bring up an extremely good point, because [Obama's usage of Executive Orders is extremely controversial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/obama-executive-orders/).  The reason why his usage of executive action is controversial is because it goes against [Youngstown Co v. Sawyer](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/343/579.html), which ruled:   &gt; The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.  But the thing to recognize is that there is no **law** dictating what a President can or cannot do in an executive order -- there is merely a justice system that has the capability of reigning back an Executive Order retroactively.  So yes -- a president can make an executive order of anything he/she wants (relevant to a Federal level, provided other restraints like the budget checks out) -- for instance FDR creating Japanese Internment Camps ([Executive Order 9066](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066)) in 1942.  However, the justice department has the capability of striking it down if: 1). It is unconstitutional, or 2). It is clear Congress does not agree with the POTUS  Obama is rather unique for challenging point (2) and debatably (1) in the case of gun control, and it remains controversial. After all, it has been brought up before that if Obama can use Executive Orders to go against the wills of Congress, it sets the **precedent** that any future Republican president will be able to do exactly the same.  Personally, I think Obama is pushing his luck based on emotional/symbolic reasons -- and I would not be surprised if such an executive order is struck down by the Supreme Court within a year.  This precedent, in my view is *extremely* dangerous. Therefore, I will disclose now that while I in my personal beliefs support gun control, I do not support the usage of Executive Orders to accomplish progressive issues if its going to set a precedent that the POTUS can override Congress.  **EDIT: I just learned that there is a [difference between ""executive actions"" and ""executive orders""](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/11/20/365467914/so-just-what-is-an-executive-action-anyway) (source: NPR), Obama never issued or planned to issue (yet) any executive orders on guns. This was misreported by various media outlets.**",15

"Edit: See below from /u/healthdeptthrowaway before taking my comment with a grain of salt.   Frequent sous vider here. As long as the fish is below 40F, there is really no risk of botulism. The risk is if it gets to 41F or greater, then botulism blooms and can produce toxins. Even then, it has to stay in that danger zone for about 4 hours before there is any real risk. [Here is essentially the sous vide safety bible.](http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html#Safety) I think some health codes put that danger zone at 2 hours though.

As of right now I'd kind of prefer to see someone else take a punt in his seat.  I considered Kevin Magnussen an upstart in 2014, and rooted for Jenson Button over him. I followed him after he was demoted and then sacked, rewatched his performances, gained a better insight into his character, and my respect for him has increased a great deal.  I liked Romain Grosjean from day one, but even though he overcame his ""nutcase"" syndrome some time before, I still couldn't help feeling slightly embarrassed over my fandom for him until observing his strongest drives last year in the stillborn Lotus.  I was similarly unimpressed by Sergio Perez until he proved himself one of the best drivers of the last season. His performance in context has convinced me not to put too much stock in junior drivers' results until they've had time to settle in.",8

No offense, but your understanding of the Chinese economic situation is many years out of date.  Even five years ago, it would have been perfectly legit to criticize them for undervaluing their currency. But that's not the case now.

"I doub tthe theory of evolution supports any creatonist belief completely, there will be definitely be some conflicts. Like for example in your link:  &gt; In this verse, we are told that Allah (Praise to Him) began the creation of human beings out of clay  Which is reconciled with this:  &gt; The scientific evidence available to us tells us that the beginning of life was in an environment similar to swamps, which are composed basically of water and and earth matter. This produced clay, where the first forms of life began in the form of single cell organisms. These organisms multiplied reproducing themselves first by splitting and division. However, later, they paired as males and females to reproduce as they took other life forms in the sea and on land. Reproduction has become in the form of uniting the watery genetic materials of males and females, as the following verse (32.8) reveals.  That's a pretty far stretch. Humans being **made out of clay** and having life as a whole (not humans) come from water are two very separate and distinct things. Honestly if we thought about everything that way we could link almost anything to everything. When explanations are so far removed from each other I doubt you could safely say that one supports the other.  Also:  &gt;  And Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth like plants.  And   &gt; This means that originally organisms started in earth, inside the stinking muddy swamps, then they left to the sea and to the surface of the earth, like plants which grow out of the earth to appear over its surface.  Again grasping at straws here. Growing out of the earth like plants being compared to organisms first evolving from water based life forms? Come on that's another far stretch. To state that it's just the Bible that has a conflicting view with evolution is a bit naive.",8

If a ref makes a horrendous call then they should be reprimanded. The league should come out  (like the DoPS) does and explain that the ref made a poor call, what the correct call would be, and suspend the ref for one game.  That's motivation to call the game right.  I'm sure if the current refs don't like the system, there would be plenty of other qualified officials chomping at the bit to get an NHL reffing gig.

If you plan to share this comment, be sure to clearly make that distinction for readers. The OP of this comment was not intending to come off as dismissive towards the misinformed, rather, the ignorant openly spreading falsehoods. Be sure to mention that, otherwise, this can be very offputting.**  Someone posted this comment in regards to questions about Bernie's economic plan. Feel free to **save** and share it with people who question his plan.  *""Actually, an economist estimated his programs would cost 18 trillion, and that 18 trillion is in fact, 5 trillion less than we're currently spending, and he wrote a lengthy article explaining it once he saw what the WSJ was doing-- conveniently leaving that fact out to fool those who don't know anything about our current or past 10 year budgets with BIG SPOOKY NUMBERS THAT LOOK SO HIGH OUT OF CONTEXT.*  *http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gerald-friedman/the-wall-street-journal-k_b_8143062.html Here's the economist's letter.*  *Also, he hasn't taken superpac money. What you're referencing is a piece by New York Times that has been debunked.*  *https://theintercept.com/2016/01/29/nyt-outside-spending/*   *You can look at his top campaign contributors https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000528 and quickly debunk the claim you're making. NYT didn't even claim he *took* SuperPAC money. They claimed he *BENEFITTED* from others taking it. More so than those who took it. Which has again, been debunked.*  *Sorry man, but you're wrong here. I'm assuming you, or other people are gonna downvote me to hide the facts, and that's fine. But ask yourself if your position is worth holding if that's the only response you have to it.*  *And while I'm here, I may as well also point out that 170 of America's top economists have endorsed Bernie Sanders. (https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf and a more reader-friendly version http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/14/170-economists-bernie-sanders-plan-reform-wall-st-rein-greed.html - not to mention https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqIr45gRr-k)*  *People who say that Bernie Sanders doesn't have sound economic policies are wrong, and in saying that, they're proving they obviously don't know much about either economic policy, or the current state of our economy, and their opinion is essentially worthless in that regard. People can shit talk Sanders for his pro LGBT, pro marijuana, pro prison reform, basically the shit they disagree with-- OPINION policy all they want. But you can't criticize him when it comes to his economic policies which are factually good for the economy. This is the most well-regarded economists in the country saying this. Not me.*  *Hate to sound like a ""WAKE UP SHEEPLE"" guy, but you're being fed lies by mainstream media who of course, has every reason to sway people not to vote for him.

"1. 12 days is certainly doable on the loan/appraisal contingency. About normal for my market, in fact, with 8 considered aggressive - origination day plus one business week.

We aren't really *supposed* to do a lot without a purchase contract... but we can do a lot without a purchase contract. :P  2. What inspection? You mean the appraisal?

Two months of rent at 10x your PITI to be left in escrow until they vacate, or they can get reasonable on the other points. :P  4. If you're lender is a call center or a big bank, this is unusual but not crazy.

"Such questions are common and are often thought unanswerable, but within Christianity the answer is ""no"".  Omnipotence in Christianity doesn't mean God can do anything conceivable.

"No one is saying ""Netflix is a human right!"" or anything like that.   While the internet has made it easier for *most* of us to access government services, find/apply for jobs, pay bills etc. *However* if everything is moved online and you *don't* have internet access, saying ""just go to the library"" is like saying to people 25 years ago ""oh you're destitute.. well we'll move your letter box/newspaper for job searching etc 5-10km away to the library"".   ( And of course, if someone can't afford the internet at home, they can't afford the cost of taking a bus every day to the library, let alone the petrol/car costs of a daily 10-20km round trip. So we're probably talking about a daily walk to the library which many destitute people are just not physically well enough for. )  For these people this is clearly far worse than the old snailmail/newspaper solution people had 25 years ago. Ensuring basic internet access in the modern world is about removing a **new barrier** to getting out of poverty. This isn't a matter of ""oh these entitled poor people demanding a luxury that no one had 25 years ago, they have it too easy!""    ",10

"LSD can be good for minor deppression, but sometimes for people with major deppressive disorder it's not an option as it's well documented that it intensifies the emotion you're having before the trip, and the whole experience has that undertone. So for someone who's so deppressed they can't get out of bed, who literally can't be excited or happy about anything, it would not be helpful. It's also very unpredictable so it's pretty risky to use it to treat deppression (not including microdosing) outside of a clinical setting.  Edit: before i get downvotes you should know I'm paraphrasing a few sections of ""LSD my problem child"" by albert hoffman",6

"New Atheism is not misogynist at all. That was purely a smear.  One of New Atheism's most prominent and beloved members is Ayaan Hirsi Ali - an immigrant woman of color. No one in the atheist movement has been sexist towards AHA (who heads up a women's rights charity that I am proud to support). If atheists were sexist towards AHA, she would've spoken up and protested alongside Rebecca Watson and co. in the aftermath of Elevatorgate.  AHA's existence and success within the New Atheist community, however, is always ignored by those who believe the atheist movement is sexist. Not only because she falsifies the narrative, but also *because she has the wrong politics*. She's a Classical Liberal and thus accepts an Individualist variety of feminism. She also is loathed because she is a critic of Islam (although she's actually softened some of her stances in recent years, in that she's more willing to accept that many Muslims do not want to live under Islamist rule).   The lived experiences of oppression endured by a woman of color in a religious fundamentalist community are *discarded wholesale* when they don't match up to the narrative of ""Muslims as an oppressed victim class whom no one in the west has a right to judge.""   What the treatment of AHA, by the advocates of the ""New Atheism Is Sexist"" narrative shows, is that so-called ""identity politics"" has very little to do with identity and a hell of a lot to do with politics. Your identity doesn't matter if you have the wrong politics. You can be gay (like Milo Yiannopoulos), trans (like Caitlyn Jenner), a woman (like Lauren Southern or Cathy Young or Christina Hoff-Sommers or Wendy McElroy), black (like Thomas Sowell or Clarence Thomas), or tick more than one of these boxes (like Ayaan Hirsi Ali who is a woman of color, or even Irshad Manji who is a *lesbian* WoC and still a Muslim), but if you even *dare* to be a conservative, or a libertarian/classical liberal, or even a leftist who still defends the values of the Enlightenment, you will get brutally slandered by the same kind of people who parrot the lie that new atheism is sexist.  A lot of people think that the primary motivation behind the so-called ""Social Justice Warriors"" is an hatred of white, cisgender, heterosexual males. I am really not so convinced of this (partially because a lot of these people are in fact cis het white males themselves).   I think its really just a war against Enlightenment values and the Enlightenment mentality. Logic, science, reason, individualism, a free and open marketplace of ideas, reaching truth through debate and discussion, humanity growing great through the exercise of our intellect, the ideal of individual liberty as a worthy political aim... Almost *every single thing* done by so-called ""SJWs"" (I hate to use the term but ""those people who advocate Intersectional Social Justice/Third Wave Feminism and believe in advancing this belief system's goals through social shaming tactics ranging from cyberstalking and doxxing to pressuring the employers of ideological enemies to fire the ideological enemy in question"" is very, very unwieldy) has been a direct attack on either the values of the Enlightenment directly *or* on cultural and physical infrastructure which supports/embodies these values.  Okay, rant over.",6

"I want to say something before this whole thing gets out of control. In 1967, in the hot desert sun, a woman gave birth to a boy in the back of old pick up. She was a whore. She left the boy at a local church. The father at the church didn't like children, but he knew that being a disciple of the bible he couldn't possibly not take the small kid. Instead he ended up taking out his frustration on the boy. At the age of three, the boy was forced to use the toilet. Let me tell you the little fell into his own pile of poop more than once. By the age of 5, the boy the boy was reading the bible and chopping wood for the fire. Despite the father's harsh character, the boy loved him and thought of him as his true father. By the age of seven the father raped him three times. The boy ran away. He survived four days in the desert by eating cactus and scorpions. He was finally found by a drug cartel boss, who took the boy in. Mr. Sanchez was his name, and he was immediately impressed by the boys intelligence and grown up attitude. Mr. Sanchez provided the boy with an education at a private prep school and a nice house. The boy had sex for the first time when he was 12, the next year he graduated high school. He was the school's star running back. The boy was lost, although he liked Mr. Sanchez, he never thought of him as his father. The boy went to India, were he became a spiritual leader of a large tribe of farmers. With his power he turned the several plots that each tribe member had into a large corporate farm and became a millionaire. His assets grew as he bought into other successful start ups. He often got ahead in business with his great leadership abilities, but once in a while he used violence. This was India after all. By the time he was 22, the boy had all the money he would ever need. So he bought a yacht and traveled the world for 10 years. For 10 years he visited every major port, slept with girls from every country imaginable, and tried every drug ever made (by nature and by man). When he was 33, he was walking on a beach in French Guiana when he met a girl of Irish - Native American decent. She bared his seed. It was boy, perfect health. He moved them to Argentina, then London, and eventually Vermont. The man was 45 now, he has seen everything, accomplished everything, tried everything. He skied down the Swiss Alps, been at the North Pole, swam with hammerheads, everything! Yet he has never done one simple thing that we all take for granted every day, he met his father. He never played catch with his father, he never talked about women with his father. He never would. He died at the age of 63 when his parachute didn't open when he was base jumping from Dagger Mountain in Washington, USA. Over three thousand people attended his funeral. I know what you are thinking. How does this story relate to me? Well I want you to go all the way back to the beginning of the story and remember the woman who gave birth to this incredible boy. You are like this woman. You are like this women because you are a whore.",10

I've seen guys that were'nt physically able to hack it, of course. But I've also seen the varsity football team captain, or a state renowned-HS athlete, etc. etc. not make it.  Interestingly enough- SOWT has an NFL player who enlisted. He went through the pipeline in...2009/10, I believe. I'm not going to name him, as I think he'd want his privacy respected. However, he **did** make it- but he had a harder time than most.  He certainly wasn't a first round pick or anything, and he was on one of the less-popular, more obscure NFL teams- but he still made it to the damn NFL, is the point.",12

"Background: Joined PwC and my group became aligned to the Strategy horizontal (Strategy&amp;). I have experience on both sides of the acquisition    The idea that people, especially partners, are leaving en masse is completely false/overblown spread by people who aren't at PwC. The ex-Booz partners in my practice have all stayed and are working alongside their PwC counterparts. Afterall, they'd be dumb to leave. Word on the street is that they got $5 million payable over 6 years to take the buyout from PwC. Who would leave that money on the table + the chance to make whatever they make as partners.  Teams are still mostly legacy Booz and legacy PwC but that is due to us having several long term projects going on at the time and resources not being able to be cross-pollinated.   Ex-Boozers used to sit in a separate area but we're starting to mingle a bit more.

"It's not entirely clear there was a god named ""Molech"". The LXX interprets it as ""melekh"", meaning ""king"". One theory is that it is related to a Punic term that refers to cultic child sacrifice. ""Molech"" could then be any cult (including that of Yahweh) that sacrificed children. However, many scholars dispute that there is any evidence of the Phoenicians sacrificing children.  Another possibility is that of a netherworld god related to Milcom (Ammon) and Milqart (Phoenicia).   That said, the Bible seems to link the name with child sacrifice performed around Jerusalem. Here's an excerpt from the DDD:  &gt; In fact, while the evidence is all too scanty, it appears to be within the realm of possibility that the cult was practised by the Jerusalem establishment prior to Josiah, presumably subsumed within the cult of Yahweh (e.g. Isaiah uses the imagery of the cult in describing what Yahweh would do to the Assyrian king [30:33] — one can hardly imagine Isaiah approving of the cult, but his words were intended to communicate, using known imagery).   In short, there *might* have been a deity called Molech, and there might have been sacrificial rituals associated with him. The textual evidence is hard to evaluate, and there's little (if any) archaeological evidence.",6

"I heard this a *lot* growing up. My hometown is an agricultural area, which was only successful throughout history because of the shit tons of migrant and illegal workers that made their way to Washington state. This influx of workers began exploding in the 90s (my childhood) due to government assistance programs that tend to favor the workers because they are the largest ethnic population living under the poverty line. Up until the late 80s, it was still very common for white people to work the fields and orchards, but it's way cheaper to hire the illegal guys, and they worked harder and faster anyway.   So what was once an area with a demographic that was probably like 90% white, suddenly started seeing a lot of non-white people moving to town, working the jobs that the old boys grew up remembering white people doing. They'd come to town and see more and more non-white people, and it probably seemed to be changing rapidly. These old ranchers do *not* like change. While they might get along just fine with non-white people in a personal setting, they get freaked out when things around this old western town started modernizing and more minorities started moving to town and it was just too much for them to handle.   These are the guys that bitch to their buddies over a beer bout all them damn Mex'cans.

They still have an old soda fountain downtown and you could buy livestock at the country store in town. I grew up in that period of extreme change, and was lucky enough to have parents that weren't afraid to kick my friend's *father* off our property when he came to drop his daughter off for a sleep over and tried to bond with *my* father by breaking the ice with ""Got damn, them Mex'cans just keep coming!

Marriage is, at it's heart, a business transaction: if you're looking to 'get into business' with this girl - maybe consider making it official.   That's more /r/relationships advice more than personal finance, but marriage is perhaps the most important financial decision you'll make in your life. If you're not ready: that's fine.

If you and the many people who agree with your views want to decide who is or isn't trans this isn't the sub for it.    I hadn't really considered crossdressers when I made my appropriation comment, for some reason what came to mind was a post a while back about a guy who used female pronouns to 'destroy the gender binary'. Drag personally makes me uncomfortable and transphobia is a massive problem within that community but their use of opposite gender pronouns isn't something I take issue with. Fetishistic crossdressers using female(/male?) pronouns I don't think is appropriation either since doing something for a thrill =! stripping a minority of its identity.

If your wife plans on breastfeeding, she will need to continue her increased caloric, protein, calcium, and iron intake.  Baby Lady is fed breast milk, but starting at 6 months I've introduced a wide range of whole foods. I read up on vegan/vegetarian nutrition for children, and there is no reason veg wouldn't grow and develop as well as omnivorous kids as long as their diet is varied. (I give her a multivitamin serving in some juice once a week just case I missed anything, and will continue to do so when she weans.) My little one eats all kinds of real food and loves it! She may get pickier as she gets older, but she will never be the kid who only eats chicken nuggets!  I've had several people ask, ""You're not going to raise her vegetarian, are you?""

It takes far more plants to make one pound of beef than it does to fill my stomach. Bypassing meat minimizes the animals killed.",6

I really don't know if it was intentionally supposed to have that effect or they really had no idea; someone in creative had to have said that wasn't a good way to book Bryan. They could of had those two as the final two and just had Roman eventually win, it would of been responded to with a ""meh"" but still wouldn't be the nuclear meltdown it actually was.

But their unbelief persisted, my disease progressed, my cancer stricken friends randomly died or were cured as if there is no logical pattern to it.

Real life might not be a fairy tale but the guy who made a ""realistic"" (or in my opinion cynical) speech about the world being harsh and unforgiving was literally swallowed by the darkness while the character of light watched.

"I'm going with the Rift over the Vive for a number of reasons.  1. Touch vs. the Vive Wands. Yes, the Vive Wands will most likely be released sooner (though really everything about the timing of the Vive release and the timing of touch is still up in the air). However, I simply want to use touch much, much more than I want to use the wands. I want to be able to have some finger dexterity, and gesturing, rather than simply to be holding a baton. I've had Leap Motion for awhile and definitely understand the desire to have ""hand presence"" in VR. However, I don't feel that the Vive Wands are sufficient for what I want from the experience.   2. I'm perfectly content to wait for Touch, because from what I've seen, between now and whenever Touch will release, there is going vastly more controller supported experiences than there are motion controlled ones anyway. It's not surprising. Motion controls were a late addition to the party this generation. A few devs were working on it early, using Hydras and such, but it's been less than a year since Vive Dev kits were even given out to developers. It simply hasn't been enough time for much in the way of quality games to be developed and ready for commercial sale. I'm fine with controller gameplay and as much as I am looking forward to motion controls at some point, right now there just isn't that much content ready. I think people have gotten a little overboard with excitement over the motion aspect and have forgotten just how fun some of the 3rd person gameplay can be as well. I'm interested in playing some strategy, rpg, tabletop, action games, etc that can all be done just fine with a controller and still are pretty incredible in VR.  3. Roomscale isn't happening for me in my house. Just a big ""nope"" for me. Not going to break down everything in my life but, Wife and Kids, house restrictions...it's just not gonna happen. It's not feasible.  4. I don't see Roomscale as being what I want from games anyway, and I expect it to ""go away"" relatively soon, when better locomotion solutions are developed. There is no reason to be stuck in a box, in terms of where you can move around. The idea is to be able to move around entire worlds, not take a few steps in each direction. The idea is to be able to run and jump and fly and swing and climb...things that are simply impossible to be solved by using roomscale. I have no idea what the ultimate end-game of VR locomation is going to look like, but it's not roomscale.  5. We still don't know the price or ship dates of the Vive, but my best guess is that I can get my Rift sooner and cheaper.  6. There appears to be somewhat more content designed for the Rift than the Vive. Perhaps devs will port them over to the Vive if the market is big enough, but as of now, there is more content, that I'm interested in, that will be available sooner for the Rift than for the Vive  ",8

"I was thinking about this the other day actually.  Spider-Man is basically the king of Street tier heroes in terms of power.  But he's skilled enough that he could push out if he really applied himself and occasionally does.  Not to mention he's way more powerful than most heroes in that class that tend to have few or no powers.  Bats with his powers would probably be a bit more effective, but not by a gigantic margine.  The way Batman takes down stronger foes when he does wouldn't really change too much other than him being able to actively scuffle with some low tier supers in the same category.  On the plus side for him he's now more durable, faster and way stronger with enhanced reflexes to boot.  Not a single martial artist (non enhanced) at this point could rival him at all.  But overall Spidermans powers would probably just make him a more effective Batman.  But he's not fighting any S-Tiers, or at least not any different than he might have before...with careful planning, exploitation of character/weakness/circumstance.  He's just a lot harder to kill now. ",17

"SC2 esports died because the game got boring. SC1 balance was/is so much better, had a lot more skill in it and the skirmishes lasted longer, while battles were fought all over.  In SC2 skirmishes end in seconds due to absurd AOE and just too high damage, while the downtime is huge with battles happening once every like 4-5 minutes.  So ultimately 2 to 3 or maybe 4 if its longer game would decide the winner and the skirmished themselves lasted less than 30 seconds.  That is not fun to watch. SC1 has a great progression, yes it was very slow at the start and for the first 3-4 minutes its bore fest, but once things got setup you got constant fights and skirmishes and drops and base takedowns, etc... for constant 15-20 minutes before the winner is decided.  Ultimately SC2 esports dying has nothing to do with sponsors or players or where the money was focused, it had to do with dwindling viewers due to boring stale gameplay! Without viewers nobody would come to sponsor the game, everything slowly dies down!  I'm one who still loves SC1 and sometimes watches is, as opposed to SC2 which I haven't watch a tournament or a match in over 2 years!",14

However, an unexpected shift in the winds began blowing the yacht in a different direction. To make matters worse, the anchor itself actually started drifting, so the anchor chain began dragging across the seabed, and then into the coral reef.  Hope that helps!",8

The only complains I have seen is that she is a bit too much of a Mary-Sue and mirrors Luke quite a lot. I guess the consens is that every hero is a bit of a Mary-Sue (including Luke) and the similiarities with Luke are due to the similiarity of the story of TFA to ANH itself and the strong themes of Star Wars (it rhymes).  ...some people might also hide their issues of having a female lead (or just misogyny) with the argument that Disney only did it to statisfy SJWs.,6

Like honestly the only threat on that team for him is the fiora and he has a poppy who can block her Q or Lee insec so he doesn't even need to worry about him.

"&gt; Many of the same people responsible for them are still the CPC critics.  Which adds to the irony of things like complaining about transparency or the Saudi Arabia weapons deal.  There have been a few about-face's since the election.    The opposition is in a bad place any way you cut it.   There is still a hate on for the CPC, despite Harper taking a back seat.  The Liberals are still very popular and the NDP seems to have lost the most support to them.    This all might change tomorrow with the fiscal update opening a hole in the Liberals boat.  I doubt they'll drop too hard, but it'll give more substance to hammer them  on.   Not that the last 100 days has been empty. The rhetoric wasn't a last resort, the CPC had a bunch of mud chambered from the campaign.  But so far nothing is sticking.  ",6
"Completely agree. Hawk and Trap would have colluded to do this in the first 2 seasons if they'd had the chance. BJ was more straight-laced, but he also hadn't been there nearly as long. By the time he showed up Hawk was cynical and jaded beyond belief. He may have joked and drank around it, but there's no way anyone can deny that by that point he was probably permanently damaged. The war had to end, and if he ever found a way to help do that he was, according to his own morals, obligated to do that.  Hawk was incredibly upset with himself, but I don't think he had any doubt in his mind that what he did was right... the ends justified the means.",13

"So this was actually changed in this last patch.  Prior to the holiday break, the matches rewarded the hell out of Mercy and other supports for Assist Kills - basically healing/boosting someone when they killed someone as Mercy or laying down a discord Orb with Zen. It all counted towards their actual ""Elimination"" score and so it was actually quite easy to get gold in that one. Granted there wasn't nearly as many categories you could actually medal in and no progression so it didn't seem to matter. From what I recall though, getting an Elimination gold with Mercy didn't mean that an actual DPS chap couldn't earn it as well - I think they snag a gold too. That might have meant that both Assists and actual damage dealt Eliminations were just lumped together....which might actually solve the problem again.  There definitely seems to be a need for a few new, separate areas where only Supports might be able to medal in, perhaps even having it rank it against the enemy's support performance at the end of the match since there's often times there are only 2-3 support between the two teams. And, like I mentioned above, maybe altering medal calculation so that a support's assist kills counted towards their Elimination score, but is awarded separately for supports versus other classes....kinda like the Olympics and Special Olympics. Both of those demonstrate amazing athletes, but awarded independently.  So the fact that you can no longer medal in many of these new/reworked categories really does hurt support player progression, you're absolutely right.  On top of that however, Mercy games also seem to be counting towards your profile career averages...which means your Eliminations/Last Hits/Solo-Kill global averages will start to nosedive like crazy if you enjoy primarily playing someone like Mercy. In my opinion, that absolutely needs to be removed. I enjoy playing in both defensive and offensive roles, so I'd like my profile to reflect my skill at either, not have those stats lumped together so it appears I'm just mediocre overall. I'm certainly not the best out there, but the fact that I almost never bust out Mercy's pea-shooter really shouldn't affect my globals...makes my Tracer play look bad. ;)",9

"You are better off putting a fan pointing inwards, pulling in cool air.   Exhaust fans are really only effective if their perimeters are sealed. The output air travels in more or less a straight line forward, but the intake air comes from not only the rear, but everywhere around the fan with a pull that reduces geometrically. If they are not sealed, their ability to move air that is not in their immediate vicinity is greatly diminished. That is not an issue for intake fans, as they are not trying to pull air from across the neighborhood and the external air pressure stays constant.",166

"Theoretically, the exhaust fan would be a tiny bit better in terms of removing heat from the room; the waste heat (generated by the fan motor and fan losses) is already in the exhaust airstream, so it never enters the room.  Practically, there will be more air movement inside the room if the fan blows in.  Wind chill and turbulence will help to cool you off more effectively than would the steady, laminar flow created by an exhaust fan.  In terms of useful effect, this more effective heat transfer from your body will far outweigh the fan heat (and the tiny adiabatic heating effect mentioned by the other poster).  Source: unsupported assertions, but am HVAC engineer.  UPDATE: To address many of the comments below, I'm assuming reality here: a single (smallish) room with two open windows, one axial fan that is appropriately sized for the window opening (so total airflow through the room will be similar whether it's intake or exhaust.  And yes, I'm also assuming minimal interaction with the rest of the house, OP did specify a room.  Chimney effect won't be significant if the room's door is closed.",1312

"If it was my choice I'd want Trump to pick Jim Webb.  Webb has been in Washington, but is not part of the establishment. Would help Trump bridge the ""lack of experience"" label.  Webb has immense military experience, something Trump might be seen as inadequate in. Also could resolve the issues people have with Trump having ""his finger on the button"".  Would be a step in bridging the divide between Dems &amp; Republicans. Webb ran as a Democrat, but like Trump has many views that overlap both parties. They could bring a new bipartisan culture that Washington sorely needs.  If you look at Trumps main issues, immigration &amp; the economy, him and Webb see eye to eye. They could reach compromise on social issues, while working together to resolve foreign policy &amp; economic ones.  A Trump/Webb ticket would throw the campaign into a whirlwind &amp; would show America that Trump is here to play fair &amp; for the people.  Trump has stated positive things about Webb in the past.

"For those not in the know about my Alma Mater's paper: In general most people pick these up on the way to class primarily to read the comics and do Sudoku as part of their daily ritual. However, they occasionally become incredibly entertaining when a couple of columnists/letters to the editor get into a back-and-forth. I think during my time, the greatest shitposting storms were either discussing Palestine/Israel or the Condoleezza Rice Graduation Speaker Controversy. Possibly when RutgersFest was canceled forever due to burning a couch in the street/people getting shot at.  Either way, I have never seen [quite this level of people writing in](http://archive.is/W0RcD).   This one is my favorite: [COMMENTARY: Enforcing ideological conformity discourages social progress](https://archive.is/s3YRx)  This one wins my ""Most likely to become a professional Columnist"" Award, which is not a compliment:  [SANCHEZ: Hate speech hiding under guise of free speech, lacks value Opinions Column: The Champagne Socialist](https://archive.is/tmHVT)  This one got me so salty that I considered writing in: [FINNERTY: Visiting speaker at Rutgers sparks old flame in New Left Opinions Column: Waxing Philosophical](https://archive.is/gfjER)  After writing a rough draft, I decided I was too lazy and old, and that the student paper should more accurately reflect the views of the current students. Later on I read the ""favorite"" article, so I decided that was good enough, and I don't have to write in.  Below is the rough draft I made for him. I guess it'll be fine here instead of the Targum. Of special note, is that it runs longer than submission guidelines and I still hadn't brought in one of my biggest criticisms of the event: It's pretty fucking retarded to bring in a British speaker to talk about the American education system and the US Constitution. The people at FIRE do excellent work and is even referenced by Milo during his speech. They're also not nearly as controversial.   &gt;Mr. Finnerty, I don't believe the ""flame"" of the left had ever died. I consider myself part of it, and I still find some of Yiannopoulos's work and views to be aligned with my own.   &gt;I find it very odd when people, regardless of their political views, refuse to confront ideas and instead choose to label and insult their opponents character. As a result I am not a fan of Yiannopoulos's characteristic unprofessional behavior and ostentatious showmanship that is often focused on insulting his opposition. Despite this, I think it's foolish to completely dismiss him and his ideas. I think it's especially foolish to label him as ""bigoted and intellectually void"" or ""entirely misogynistic"".  &gt;During the talk (according to audio recording and articles), Yiannopoulos asked those who believed in the wage gap to raise their hands. Immediately after, he called them all idiots. If someone were to stop listening there, call him a misogynist, and leave the building, that person would have done themselves a disservice. The statement is followed by a serious note that clarifies that his attention-grabbing headline has factual nuance behind it. What followed is a criticism of advocacy research and the ignorant, biased or sensationalized reporting of mainstream media. What he said about the 79% number is true: that it's a misleading number that includes so many easily accounted-for variables that it should be immediately discarded. His namecalling of ""idiots"" is directed at people that blindly believe in that number, blame systematic sexism for the whole of it, and never thought to look at what the number really meant. When such a shallow analysis of the data can bring people to mislead conclusions that reach all the way to the White House, we have a serious problem, regardless of what we believe the true wage gap to be.  &gt;In the same way that the ""idiots"" insult can derail Yiannopoulos's opponents from hearing the rest of the message, Yiannopoulos's propents seem to be getting stuck on the accusations of bigotry. They don't keep their ears open to hear. ""Sure, one may speak freely and say what they wish, but there is nothing about the consequence of one’s actions"", as you say. They should have been prepared for the backlash and handled it better, rather than simply yelling ""shut the fuck up"" and chanting ""Trump"". The indignant protesters were right to say that free speech applies to them as well and it was disappointing to see so many people handling themselves poorly on both sides. If the Young Americans for Liberty had more interest in airing their grievances than creating a spectacle, they certainly could have chosen a better speaker. This leads me to my greatest complaint of your piece. Describing him as ""world’s most boring and reactionary man to speak"" is completely false. If there's anything certain at all in this mess, it's that it was not a boring event.  &gt;I, like many other of the commenters here, have other issues with your accusations of bigotry, but hopefully mine are a bit more descriptive than their cheap slogans. I don't think that taking a stand against inaccurate interpretations of statistics makes someone a misogynist (even if they take it too far to say that there is NO wage gap. The data suggests there are still ""unexplained"" disparities in the data that could be explained by discrimination. I believe in Yiannopoulos's home country, the wage gap is reversed for young men and women, but I would assume that also doesn't account for profession, hours worked, or education level.). At first I thought his views on lesbians was a gay man joke, but after his explanation, I'm pretty sure he really doesn't believe in lesbians. I'm not positive you can consider it homophobic, but there's still something that can be said about his views on the T portion of LGBT. I think that just goes to show that you should always listen to your ideological opponents with an open mind: they'll either teach you something new or they'll give you the rope to hang themselves with. I also didn't find the views he shared to be racist. I'm honestly not sure where this accusation comes from. From his description, I would argue that he's more xenophobic. He doesn't consider his darker skinned compatriots to be anything other than British, but he considers immigrants/refugees to have a very foreign culture that he doesn't consider to be compatible with Western values. I think this is an important distinction. I suggest that if you make such frequent attacks on his character, you at least use the correct ones.   &gt;And finally, to come back around to your central points. You find his speech to be hateful and deserving of the consequences that entails when in a liberal University. You have a problem with ""allowing such an individual air time in the first place"" and assert that he is ""some chimera of vocal abuse under the guise of freedom"". You are glad that your fellow students took a stand against him by interrupting him repeatedly and protesting. I'm glad we're almost on the same page. I'm glad students criticize him, criticize the Young Americans for Liberty's choices, and criticize each other for their stances on his visit and the content presented during the event (even if that tends to stray into juvenile name-calling on social media). However, I'd rather they had not done it while he was trying to speak. I prefer he had the same respect we give any of our other guests. The most rude things I've witnessed for any previous events were students coming late, falling asleep, or leaving halfway through, but now we can add facepainting and yelling to our list.  The last time I got this upset over a Targum Article was when ""[Drones have no place in universities Column | Thought Control Café](http://archive.is/ktdDs)"" was written. Keep in mind that this was written while I was in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department for a Masters'. Several of our professors research robotics, and we have competitive autonomous robotics teams on both ground and air. One of our researchers was doing ""sea"" as well, but I forget who, and that wasn't a student club team. Either way, I'm sure we're all incredibly interested in what you're doing and thinking and that Rutgers is soon to have an expensive UAV program when literally every door has a camera watching it, and you have to use your student ID to swipe into your dorm room. Not to mention all the rights you sign away every time you connect to the Rutgers internet.  As a friend noted: &gt;""According to a study by the New America foundation, between 2004 and 2010, the United States carried out 114 drone strikes, killing between 830 and 1,210 people (and, as the study estimates, about 500-800 of those people were militants). This means that roughly a third of the number of deaths were civilians. And now, drone technology is coming to America and its campuses. What does this mean for university students?""  &gt;Huge casualties, obviously.  As a final note, I have an acquaintance who is in gender studies program. Apparently someone suggested getting Milo as a speaker in one of her polysci classes. The suggestion was met with shock and blank stares, followed by general public disapproval. ",31

"P/E ratio is how the market values a stock.  Typically a higher p/e is associated with companies with higher projected growth over the coming years.   For instance, compare a mature industrial company to a new tech company. The industrial company may be producing $1 eps and trading at $10 for a P/E of 10. The tech company might be producing $0.10 eps and trading at $10 for a P/E of 100.  This would indicate that the market assumes the tech company will grow at a much more rapid rate than the industrial company since its P/E ratio is so much larger.   The best practice in judging under/over valuation with a P/E ratio is to compare the company to its peers and industry as a whole. ",15

"The biggest problem with the T1A Unity, and with directive ARs in general, is that the forward grip on it is ""special"". By special I mean that while normal forward grips usually increase the equip time on the weapon, this one doesn't, and it comes at the cost of not decreasing the horizontal recoil as much as it normally should. The decrease in equip time was almost unnoticable, and the fact that it's on a primary makes it even worse, since you usually switch from a primary to a sidearm in a fight, not the other way around. So there's a notable downside for what is basically a worthless upside, and that's the biggest problem.  Additionally, the T1A Unity and NC1 Gauss rifle could use some faction flavor or just something more impressive than a ""wowee, this gun has a crappy forward grip!"" Maybe give the Unity a spinup or a special suppressor that doesn't screw over your bullet velocity and thus turn it into a more close-range oriented T1, perhaps? Maybe give the Gauss Prime proper HVA to make it the highest bullet velocity weapon in the game (since bullet velocity IS, in fact, an NC faction trait)? I don't know, I just know that the guns need to stick out more. There's basically no reason to use the T1A over the standard T1 aside from the soft point, and even then the benefit's not THAT amazing since it's the same amount of headshots to kill at any range anyway.",10

Those issues are lazily blended in with artists' financial concerns and Tiffany Barton, behind it all, has chosen to be combative with the festival rather than allying with them.  The success of Fringe is due to its laissez-faire, free-market approach. Either you run a more curated festival like PIAF and artists have no opportunity to perform, or you make it more open and artists just have to acknowledge and factor in the financial risk involved. I absolutely think the Fringe model is much better for emerging artists and for the culture of Perth.

"Yeah, I'm starting to question this as well! What I've noticed lately is the original reports and interviews say one thing but they take on an entirely different narrative as time goes on.   I read back the new reports that were released, and Wiegert's initial reports suggest that Teresa's last call was from Auto Trader, before that her voicemail, and before that Steve Avery.  The 2:41 call doesn't have anyone listed. Im not sure if more information is out there on this call? But it makes you question the official timeline greatly. [Also read this on Zipperer testimony](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/436rzp/the_george_zipperer_theory_beligerant_phone_calls/) tl:dr - Kratz objected to Buting questioning Mrs Zipperer, and judge agreed, told them they could ask the officer if they had any question, Dedering, Kratz declared Dedering was up next to testify. Dedering was never called to testify.  ---   If you look at the earlier interviews, the mail was stated by SA that his mom brings him the mail, then we see later stye get Brendan to say he brought the mail.  We hear about the deer being killed - roadkill, SA says they called the police to claim the deer (I presume that's normally how you go about that) but then later the police put him killing Teresa in the garage.   Its like they took the actual events and just made their own version up, then pushed witnesses until they agreed and said the same thing.  There was another thread about an early report saying that Teresa had another appointment, I believe it was reported by CBS.  I made the comment, [""prosecution knew they couldn't get a conviction with the details they had so they formed their own story""](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/43ekr0/wayback_machine_find_reported_teresa_continued_on/czhov94)  Someone replied to me and took issue with my comment:  &gt;Yea that's a lot more likely than someone got a little information wrong in the early days of the case...  Then posted 'proof' that early testimony is unreliable,   Unfortunately for the person making the point, [the article states the opposite](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/) (well, it states that too) but that testimony gets less and less reliable, because simply asking questions can change the facts people remember:  &gt;Even questioning by a lawyer can alter the witness’s testimony because fragments of the memory may unknowingly be combined with information provided by the questioner, leading to inaccurate recall.",9

I read about the Estus flasks and taking away of Moon Grass and the concept of Bonfires and said ""No No No that's not how you did it in Demons Souls!"" and when I bought and played Dark Souls I realized why it and the games themselves were so amazing... It gave so many new aspects it was a brand new experience.   Dark Souls 2 came along and it wasn't like Dark Souls 1 and so many people complained but I loved it. I'm going into Ds3 knowing it's going to be fresh and a different level to once again separate itself from the rest of the games.   If you are buying this game with the hope that ""well I hope it's like Dark Souls 2,thats the only game I've played"" or similar you are going to be let down if you don't understand why this franchise and company is so special.   To me it's like having DaVinci do another painting after the Mona Lisa and saying ""Why didn't you paint another picture of a girl with long hair?

"Morality aside, it's 2016. If women want to terminate a pregnancy they will find a way to do it whether abortions are legal or not. Only thing outlawing abortion will do is see women turn to back-alley abortions and/or more dangerous methods. So even if the idea of ""killing babies"" (as they love to put it) doesn't sit right with you, which would you prefer? Pregnancies are terminated as safely and efficiently as possible, or as brutally and dangerously as possible? Because those are the only real choices here, unless you seriously believe writing a law will suddenly change millions of women's minds about what they can and can't do with their bodies.  I feel this is a more solid argument than arguing morals since morality is very subjective. The truth is pro-lifers are only pro-life because they haven't put any serious thought into the matter.

That doesn't exist because the callers, as infrequent as they are, are a self selecting group of superfans, not literally 14 year olds that have a boner question and heard a radio show that might be able to answer it. In order to call in you have to:  1: follow the show on Twitter 2: happen to see when they are takin calls 3: have something that Adam feels is worth talking about in the context of the show 4: be willing to call during work.   The fact that you can't have a passerby at midnight, or later on the east coast, call in eliminates spontaneity completely. its why he does the same bits, tells the same stories.

Bernie really got me with his stance on veterans and his willingness to give the people who have come to our country looking for opportunities to stay here. I do agree with the need to make it harder to get across our border but do not believe mass deportation (as Trump has suggested and originally I was on board with) is the key to solving our immigration problems. I also like that Bernie wants to tighten background checks on weapons and ban assault weapons. As someone who is in the military I feel there is no reason for a civilian to have assault rifles.,9

"&gt;Devils. They've always flown under my personal radar for some reason.  Step on up! Step on up! Come and learn about this team that sometimes you hate but are so damn loveable that you can't actually hate them. First off, know that our prospect pool is not as bad as some make it out to be. We have some high prospects (Pavel Zacha, Mackenzie Blackwood, Steven Santini, Josh Jacobs, John Quenneville, Blake Speers, Ken Appleby, Brett Seney could be a dark horse). We have other prospects that we are working on and developing (Blake Coleman, Ryan Kujawinski, Graham Black, Reece Scarlett, Blake Pietila), while some don't look very promising (Brandon Baddock and possibly Connor Chatham). It's a brand new system that we're putting people into and so far, it is doing wonders.   And we have some great young talent. Adam Larsson (my absolute favorite player on the entire team), Adam Henrique (our Alternate Captain, goes by Rico, and is an absolute, god damn handsome man), Sergey Kalinin (a Russian forward we signed in the offseason who is doing wonders right now), Damon Severson (a young defenseman we have who is still learning in certain areas but has loads of potential and promise), Reid Boucher (a call-up from the Albany Devils (our AHL affiliate) that is showing his skill and looks to be showing his true game), Joseph Blandisi (another AHL call-up that has made his case for staying up with the team and is proving to be an absolute spark for this team in terms of offense), and Kyle Palmieri (the forward we traded a 2nd and a 3rd to Anaheim for in the 2015 Draft. He is a player that is deserving of an extension. Tons of skill, fun locker room guy, is from New Jersey, and one of our best scorers behind Michael Cammalleri).  To go with this, we have Cory Schneider in net with Keith Kinkaid as his partner in net. Kinky is a solid backup and is reliable when Schneider needs a break. Schneider? Come on. It's Cory. The Ginger God. Schneiderman. He is one of the reasons as to why we are in so many games. He's absolutely great and is a fan favorite. One of the best goaltenders in the league and is a beautiful sight to see us go from Broduer to Schneider.  Patience is key when it comes to this team. Any sucess we have had this year was not supposed to happen. But with a new system, a new outlook, a new team, a youth movement, a new culture, and thinking ahead instead of thinking about right now, this team is gonna go places in the future.

"&gt;People will adapt; it's what they've always done, it's what they will always do.  You might be thinking about the human species as a whole - because there are plenty of instances where communities have failed to adapt and have been wiped out for it.  Of course, the problem is, the scale of effect here is unprecedented.... as a result, the scale of response required to adapt is also unfortunately, unprecedented.  And in this instance, the tech is absolutely relevant. Broad band stating that its irrelevant without examining how that technology disrupts the fundamental assumptions that underpin the 'economic axioms' is the height of foolishness.  We're talking about technology that encroaches on the aspect of humanity that until now, that's been exclusively the domain of a human being... which is cognitive intelligence.  Without that advantage... what can we honestly economically offer that is of great value? It's a big question, and I'm willing to wait. Because if you can solve it to a reasonable degree, there's probably an economic prize in it for you.  With all this been said, I'm not saying that humans as a whole can't adapt, or that we can't prosper with automation. Indeed, I'm saying quite the opposite. I am saying though that to do so, some of the economic dogma that mainstream economists (like yourself) take for granted will have to be reassessed in light of new developments.  There is a deep and intricate interaction between economic function, their axiomatic rules and technologies. That economists can ignore that connection is a sad example of how lazy they've gotten about their profession really.",8

"Unless you come across like as cranky as you do in that comment, a casual approach to an employee to ask what is up with the current batch of veggies isn't going to ruffle any feathers.  Just be reasonable and polite, and talking to a manager often gets the problem fixed.  Sometimes it shows them a problem they didn't know they had, because whether you know it or not, by FAR most customers are like you and are reluctant to talk to a manager, they just stop being customers eventually.  Speaking to a manager doesn't automatically mean copping an attitude and giving them a piece of your mind.  You could try ""Hey, sorry to be a pest, I know you're busy, but do you know what's up with the veggies this week?  They don't look as fresh as they normally do.""    It's not directly confrontational, it doesn't point blame at anyone, and it will get an answer to your question or even an immediate remedy for your problem.  A vast majority of the customer complaints I have to deal with are very reasonable and friendly, and I'm usually happy for the feedback, because you can't fix a problem you didn't realize you have.  Sure, once in a while you have to listen to some jerk vent all his frustrations on you over a minor mistake (or perceived mistake), but even sometimes the fuming mad customers still have a valid point buried beneath their cursing and yelling.  Anyway, my point is.. you aren't necessarily doing the employees any favors by just being silent, and you certainly aren't doing yourself any good. Being assertive and proactive also doesn't automatically make you a yuppie snob soccer-mom either, it's all in your approach.  Be tactful.  On the other hand, it's just veggies so you could just buy them elsewhere if it's consistently bad and you flat-out refuse to talk to anyone about it, that's perfectly reasonable as well.",9

Within a couple of days we got used to it, tried out a bunch of positions and found our favorites, and had great sex all the time.   Sex changed our relationship both for better and for worse. While the sex was awesome and it made us more attached to each other, we made some bad decisions regarding birth control (mainly lack thereof). While we were very lucky not to have any unplanned pregnancies come out of it, the *constant* back and forth of having unprotected sex in the heat of the moment, worrying about the fact that we didn't use protection, and then continuing to have unprotected sex and continuing to worry about it was very stressful and partly led to our eventual break-up.

Zeus and his conflict with Kronos in many ways bears a striking resemblance to Odin and his conflict with Ymir save for a couple of differences, a major difference being that Zeus didn't need nearly as much help as Odin did.  Odin, according to the texts that talk about him, also has limits, where Yehovah seems to be, according to the texts that talk about him, a lot closer to omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence than Odin. Zeus also beats Odin on sheer raw power, in fact, every Greek deity does, because the Greek deities are deathless, and Odin is just like any other person in that if you can inflict a fatal wound on him he will die.  Odin, even though he is called a god, is a lot more like Vainamoinen from the Finnish Kalevala, or even the mortal version of Vishnu.

"Well number 1 rule is if you don't feel like conversing with people, don't unless you have to. There are many days that I will just stay to myself at home. It helps me recharge. I'm an introverted person by nature so being animated and extroverted during the day is completely draining to me.   But as far as building a sincere interest in people, here's what I've concluded (and I've seen this echoed on Reddit and in books): everyone is the star in their own personal story.   Think about your life and everything you've experienced. Adventure. Defeat. Success. Love. Fear. Depression. Sadness. Loss. Excitement. Remember your first love? Remember the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you? Think about how animated you get when your favorite team wins or how sad you were when your favorite TV character got killed off. Think about how much you love your hobby. Think about the things you wish you could have done or taken back. The times you saved someone from a black hole of sadness or when someone saved you. Your life story is long and full of pages. You could go on for days recounting your life and talking about your plans and desires for the future. You are the author and star and you have co-stars and recurring guests, cameos and background characters.   Now think about the person you are taking to. They have a whole entire story just as FULL as yours and completely different! You have the opportunity to learn their story. Their saga. Their emotions. Their desires. Their motivations. Their life. I think that is amazing. They are a character in your book, but to them, you're a character in theirs.   We only tend to focus on our life because that's all we know, but there are 6-7 billion other independent people in the planet that have a whole life story to tell.   You can be interesting by telling your life story. But to have a sincere interest in people is to want to know theirs.   In my line of work, I have to find ways to motivate people to get what I need done accomplished. Getting to know the people, building a relationship, and finding out what motivates them helps me tremendously.   I read a book called the carrot principle about building morale and improving recognition in the workplace and what not, but the major thing that stuck with me is remembering people's interests and motivations. For a lot of the people I meet, I take mental notes and then later, add that into my contacts under notes for them.   For example:  One person that I worked with on occasion (3-4 times a year) has this information in his contact info on my phone: Dallas Cowboys fan. KC Royals fan. 2 children and wife. Daughter attends [college]. Likes to goof around. 25+ years experience in company.  So I utilize that information to help me ask him about his life and keep and maintain a solid relationship with him. I follow football so I'm able to freely talk to him about the Cowboys. Since he likes to goof off and joke, I rub in that my team, the Patriots, are doing better. I don't know much about baseball but I ask him how the Royals are doing. His daughter attends college so I get to ask him around holidays, usually when I see him, if she was able to come home for the holidays.   It helps me remember because I meet so many people. I'm truly interested in his life but I sometimes need social reminders when I haven't seen someone in a while, so it's a tool I use.   Being interested in people just takes you not worrying about yourself in conversation. Once you get to that point, you'll get multiple opportunities to share your own story to people.  ",31

"This quote is probably from Pindar. Its a fragment which, I believe, is today only known indirectly from Plato's Theaetetus (173e):  &gt; And all these things the philosopher does not even know that he does not know; for he does not keep aloof from them for the sake of gaining reputation, but really it is only his body that has its place and home in the city; his mind, considering all these things petty and of no account, disdains them and is borne in all directions, as Pindar says, “both below the earth,” and measuring the surface of the earth, and “above the sky,” studying the stars, and investigating the universal nature.  Some (like Harold Fowler) have suggested that it might refer to Pindar's Nemean 10:  &gt; And Zeus... said...: “You are my son. But Castor was begotten after your conception by the hero, your mother's husband, who came to her and sowed his mortal seed. But nevertheless I grant you your choice in this. If you wish to escape death and hated old age, and to dwell in Olympus yourself with me and with Athena and Ares of the dark spear, you can have this lot. But if you strive to save your brother, and intend to share everything equally with him, then you may breathe for half the time below the earth, and for half the time in the golden homes of heaven.”  However, from the context I'm doubtful if Marcus is thinking of Nemean. It is probably something lost which we only know from Plato.  Sources: Haines Commentary on Loeb's Marcus Aurelius, Fowler's Commentary on Plato, Svarlien's edition of Pindar's Odes",6

"1. The defense goes first with its case.   The state hasn't even begun to present its case yet. So I don't have a clue who they might bring in as witnesses.   2. Defense has the burden of proof.   It is generally really bad lawyering for a responding party to bring in the witnesses that were necessary to prove the moving party's case, but weren't brought in.   So if I were the prosecution, I certainly would not be doing anything to fill in the gaps in the defense case for them.  ",10

"“Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.” -Brian Eno",570

"My ""Not-A-Clinton-Liker-Yet"" take on things is Hillary simply doesn't want to be forced to commit to specific proposals on anything because her OVERWHELMING mindset as a politician is ""prevent defense"" - how can she avoid saying anything that anyone can grab onto to attack her later.   Any time she is asked a question she will overwhelm you with detail and nuance and talk about how ""important"" things are and how we ""need to find ways to come together to achieve"" blah blah blah but there is never a real plan there. I want to vote for a President who not only understands our problems but has a plan to fix them. I feel that a big drawback of the Obama Presidency has been that he came into office talking about how big a problem certain things were and then he was willing to sign WHATEVER Congress did just to show that he took action on that issue. That's how we ended up with the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and the partial sunset of the Bush Tax Cuts, all three of which are compromise-ridden kludges that didn't really solve the problem.  The visceral appeal of Sanders is that he offers solutions. The problem is those solutions are delusional both in how likely they are to be implemented and how likely they are to work. That doesn't let Clinton off the hook - she needs to propose alternatives.  I think Sanders has been a terrible weak sauce candidate and in truth he has let Clinton coast to the nomination. Those million donors and probably 2 or 3 won primaries, not-withstanding.",12

"A few years back, there were billboards in some parts of the U.S. with that same claim. Here was the response (emphasis added).  Steve Klein, a senior researcher with the Atlanta-based King Center, said that King never endorsed candidates from either party. **""I think it's highly inaccurate to say he was a Republican because there's really no evidence,""** Klein said. A King biographer, Taylor Branch, also said Thursday that King was nonpartisan.  Rev. Joseph Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, said there is no reason why anyone would think King was a Republican. He said King most certainly voted for President Kennedy, and the only time he openly talked about politics was when he criticized Republican Barry Goldwater during the 1964 presidential campaign.    ""That was not the Martin I know and I don't think they can substantiate that by any shape, form or fashion. It's purely propaganda and poppycock,"" Lowery said. **""Even if he was, he would have nothing to do with what the Republican Party stands for today.""**  On hearing of the billboards sponsored by the National Black Republican Association and claiming that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican, Lowery said ""These guys never give up, do they?  Lord have mercy."" ",14

"In my opinion, the betters are probably listening to 'conventional wisdom' and what 'political insiders' are saying in the news to determine their bets.  The conventional wisdom had been that Trump would fall apart when it came time to vote. There was also some reason to be skeptical of the polls (recent blunders at calling high profile elections in the last year, Trump's support changing by as much as 10 points depending on how the poll was conducted).  And conventional wisdom AND 'political insiders' have both been saying that Trump would get murdered in a general election. Hence that's likely a big part of why the betting markets weren't so hot on Trump for a while.  So chances are a lot of gamblers believed all that stuff.",9

$60 for a game is a historic low price for the top end game with new options at multiple price points. Their budgets roughly try to estimate what they'll make and allocate a portion of that to making the game and a portion to advertising.

The SS answered directly to the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler and not the Wehrmacht chain of command. The SS was composed of the Allgemeine SS (General SS), the Waffen-SS (Armed SS), and the SS-Totenkopfverbände. The Allgemeine SS concerned itself with police and racial matters within Nazi territory. The Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. The SS-TV ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. The SS also contained the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), or ""Security Service"" which answered directly to Heinrich Himmler and served as the police and intelligence arm of the SS.  * Abwehr - Literally ""Defence"" was the military intelligence organization of the German state. Similar to the American CIA or DIA. It was a government office that predated the Nazi party and often clashed with the SS on security and intelligence matters.

"Not OC, but relevant:    Subject: cc: Mail Text FOODPORN: Pornography for dieters (?) by Frank LaRosa    Dear Editors,    I read your fine magazine eagerly each month, and one of my favorite features is the letters you receive from your readers. I always enjoy hearing about their exploits, but until now I never thought anything like that could ever happen to me. However all that changed last Friday night, when I had one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and felt I just had to write and share it with everyone.    It was about 10:30 PM and I was sitting in my dorm room going over some boring math homework that I really didn't feel like doing. Normally there is plenty to do on Friday nights at my college, but it was the first day of spring break and the campus was practically deserted. Since I couldn't afford to go to Florida with my buddies, I was forced to spend the vacation on campus by myself. I was fully expecting a rather dull week of nothing but studying and watching TV.    Anyway, I was concentrating on my math book when suddenly I heard a loud bang and a screech coming from outside. I rushed to the window to see what had happened. On the street below I saw a white minivan with the words ""Carlo's Italian Restaurant"" on the side. The van pulled slowly to the side of the road, obviously suffering from a tire blowout. Relieved at an excuse to break up the monotony of my studying, I decided to go outside and see if I could be of any help.    As I approached the van I could see the driver, an overweight, brown haired woman who introduced herself as Gail. We both examined the flat tire and I asked Gail where she was heading. She said she was supposed to deliver an order of Italian food to a party, some rich eccentrics who lived in the upper part of town, she said. But the party had been cancelled at the last minute and she was returning with their order. She said she didn't think there was a spare tire in the van but I suggested that we take a look anyway.    We went around to the back of the van and Gail opened the rear doors. A warm rush of steam came from inside, carrying the rich scent of fresh tomato sauce and Italian bread. In the cargo area were trays and trays of lasagna, meatballs, and pork smothered in sauce. A stack of pizza boxes lay to one side, and I could see what looked like a case of beer towards the back. Never in my wildest fantasies had I seen anything like the banquet that lay before me now. After living on lousy school cafeteria food for the past two months, it all seemed something like a dream come true.    Gail looked around and said she couldn't find the spare tire. She sighed, giving me a strangely seductive look. ""Well,"" she said, ""I guess I won't be able to get back to the restaurant for a while. It would sure be a shame to let all this food go to waste."" At that, I knew something incredible was about to happen. Gail manouvered her pudgy frame into the back of the truck. I couldn't believe my eyes as she began unwrapping the mountain of food before us. ""Here,"" she said, handing me a huge tray of lasagna. The dish was warm and heavy and full of rich Italian smells. When I looked back I noticed that Gail had started without me and was already busy with a large, greasy pepperoni pizza.    I sat on the edge of the van and removed the tin foil from the lasagna tray. I peeled the foil back slowly, carefully, revealing the hot pleasures within. The sauce oozed like lava around the melty mozarella cheese, and pools of oil were everywhere. I ran my finger along the edge of the plate, and then gently through the heart of the food, delighting in the warm, slippery feel of the pasta underneath. After a few minutes of working my fingers in and out I removed them and slowly licked off the sweet-tasting sauce.    My sense of hunger heightened, I lifted the tray closer to my face. My hands sank into the center of the lasagna, scooping out huge globs of pasta, sauce, and cheese. I lifted the food to my mouth and stuffed it sloppily into my waiting hole. I chewed and swallowed deeply, my eyes closed in ecstasy. My entire digestive tract tingled as the food made its way down my esophagus and into the pit of my stomach. Incensed, I grabbed hungrily for the lasagna, stuffing my mouth till it was about to burst, choking it down so fast that it almost hurt, and stuffing my face again. In a matter of minutes I had lapped up the entire tray, licking it clean so as to get every drop.    I stood up and caught my breath. After such a feast I was sure I could eat no more, but the sight of several open pizza boxes soon had me going again. Reaching out, I tore off about half of a huge 15 inch pizza covered with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage. I folded the thick dough and thrust the pizza mouthward, alternately chewing at the crust and then sucking in the tender, cheesy filling. My mind in a blissful daze, I spent the next several minutes in this position, until I had devoured every last mouthful.    By this time Gail had discovered the beer, and she handed me a tall, frosty bottle. I wrenched off the cap and lifted the beer to my mouth, pouring it eagerly down my throat. As I drank in a frenzy, beer spilled out the corners of my mouth and dripped onto my face, neck and clothing. Oblivious to the world, I continued consuming the brew like a madman until every drop was gone.    Finally, I could take no more. Grasping my stomach, I stumbled towards the grass on the side of the road. I opened my mouth and burped into the warm night, longer and louder than I had ever done before. The substance of my belch seemed to hang in the air in front of me, thick with the aroma of pizza and beer. I burped a second time, then lay on the soft ground and fell into a deep, satisfying sleep.    When I awoke several hours later, Gail and the restaurant van were gone. I never saw them again after that night, but the fond memories of our encounter will stay with me forever. Perhaps someday I'll meet Gail again, and if I do I'll be sure to write and tell you all about it.    - Name and address withheld by request",17

"En'taro Tassadar!  To be honest I ranked to Plat as toss lass season (gold now, not enough games yet this season) and I don't really have all that bailed down yet.  The thing about protoss is you almost have to decide in advance how you want to open (tech wise). I don't know how much you know about openers but the generally accepted ones are   14 pylon 16 gate 17 gas (wait until nexus goes down to saturate gas) 19 nexus 20 cyber 21 2nd gas 22 pylon.  And 14 pylon 16 gate 17 gas 18 gas (2 in each gas until 16 on mineral line and rally into gas) 19 cyber.  The second build I recommend for ulrena versus t and p. I use the first most of the time.   (14 pylon 17 nexus 17 gate 18 double gas is another build but I only use that on dusk and orbital and never against terran.)  All that said, your mothership core should be what you build as soon as your cyber core is done. Start warp gate with your next 50 gas but don't chrono it unless you got it late or plan to do an early all in.   Your next building is your first torch choice. Robo is considered the safest choice as obs deals with widow mines and dts and immortals are op. Stargate is good for Oracle or phoenix openers for harass. Twilight council gives the 3 upgrades you'll ultimately want at least one of in every match. Unless I'm playing against zerg blink is my first research unless I'm going phoenix adept vs zerg.  Protoss units are meant to complement each other. Vs terran you want stalkers but you need charge zealots or adepts to tank for them because marauders hurt a lot. Versus immortals you want sentries for guardian shield (although that could be argued for in every match up). Against mutas you generally want phoenix but archons shred them. The thing is to have a general idea what you want your unit comp to be going into a match up and change things around based on what your opponent is doing. Ultimately your gateway units will simply support your higher tech units.  Follow mcanning, statesct, liquidmana. Those are twitch streamers and professional gamers. They're also really interactive with their viewers and explain what they're doing.",7

When TR made that statement, he also stated that the people had elected McKinley and not TR so TR declared that he would maintain the policies of the McKinley administration and would only bring his own policies if he was elected for another term. This essentially made TR a one term president as he was not able to implement his policies over both terms (by his own choice). By hand picking Taft to succeed him, TR felt his policies would long live on. Taft only wanted to park his fat ass on the Supreme Court and basically ignored TR's policies and did whatever he wanted. This enraged TR and he created the Bull Moose Party to take him down.  Edit: One thing I forgot to mention - Taft was never VP, he was TR's Secretary of War.",8

"&gt;  left leaning students union  No particular union was involved.  &gt; They shouted the following slogans:  There is no evidence they shouted these slogan. In fact there is strong evidence that ABVP(student wing of BJP) shouted anti-India slogans in order to implicate their rival protest groups. A probable proof for that has been posted on this sub.  &gt; It is a clear case of anti-India and anti-people activity  It still doesn't constitute sedition. As explained here:  [No, the slogans of the JNU students don't count as sedition under the law](http://scroll.in/article/803522/no-what-the-jnu-students-did-doesnt-count-as-sedition-under-the-law)  &gt;advocating revolution, or advocating even violent overthrow of the state, does not amount to sedition, unless there is incitement to violence, and more importantly, the incitement is to “imminent” violence  **Here is the actual run down of the events.**  JNU is bastion of humanists groups. Since India suffers from terrible caste-system (Indian version of racism and slavery) and oppression of tribal people for mining, forest and agricultural land, some of the students of JNU given their nascent humanistic outlook have justifiably developed strong anti-caste attitude. They have been a bulwark against tyranny of the majority. This tyranny in India has many forms like casteism, feudalism, anti-tribalism, patriarchy, statism, communalism etc. JNU has been fulcrum of various movements against these tyrannical forces and various ideological structure that nourish  them including rabid-nationalism and it's students have been flag-bearers of egalitarianism.   Since some of their ideological positions are in opposition to the interests of entrenched status-quo, they have been portrayed as anti-India. Their nationalism which is essentially based on compassion, fairness and egalitarianism is often vilified for lacking strength and hardness that can be apparently and delusionally seen in the militarism of the 'right-wing'.  Given this context it is all too understandable that JNU had angered the right-wing. Right-wingers for some time now have been seeking a revenge against JNU and what it stands for. Prominent right wingers like Subramanian Swamy and others have repeatedly demanded to bring JNU to the heel and put it in its place even before any of this happened. The atmosphere for the witch-hunting was set for months. Needed was an evidence however insignificant or illegitimate.  You see JNU is a big place and the number of students there counts in thousands. Unsurprisingly it has got it's own share of people who hold extreme views. The protest that ensued the whole controversy was not even given any permission from the authorities. So it was just a bunch of people with no affiliation to a single group protesting over some issues that they felt needed more awareness. ABVP which was keeping a constant vigilance over campus-activities after they lost last JNU election, got the air of the protest. They reached the venue. An exchange of words and slogans must have happened. Others like student union leader reached there too in order to mitigate any conflict. Some uncomfortable slogans were raised. The identity of who actually raised the slogans is uncertain but there is some evidence that it was ABVP guys who did it. But none of this mattered to the disgruntled sheeps who were looking for exactly this kind of the thing. Student union leader was arrested and a case of sedition was filed.             ",22

There's usually some presence of kink people, although it's not a lot of people these days unless there's a special event.  Depending on what the jurisdiction allows, there could be porn on the TVs and some open sexual activity, although not usually between people who you'd want to see fucking in a bar.

"I don't think we would have readily and fully realized what a threat Voldemort truly was, even in the days when he had little in the form of a following.  And he was, even as nothing but a shadow, the most formidable foe Harry could ever imagine. It took the severity of CoS to truly engrave in our minds the danger and to allow us to fully understand why even just the mention of his name was so terrifying for the entire wizarding world.  If it had gone from the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone right into Prisoner of Azkeban, we would have also had Sirius a year sooner, giving the reader, only two books into the series, a false sense of security for Harry. I think we needed the first two books to see him struggling on his own with only his two best friends.  Seeing Sirius as a life line so early in the series, while also not seeing Voldemort as a serious threat, might have crippled the story line entirely by not seeming as urgent or tragic.  I think the way she wrote it was more effective at hooking us into the story. Me personally, if I saw Harry's no-family problem solved in book 2 and no sign of the devil, I might not have kept reading. It was the sitting-on-the-edge-of-my-seat-not-knowing-what's-next thing that kept me coming back for more.  EDIT: Plus it would be a bit confusing to have Voldemort in full power after he received bone of the father and then to also be dealing with Tom Riddle.

"Matt Ridley talks about this in his book [The Rational Optimist](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rational-Optimist-Prosperity-Evolves/dp/0061452068). He points out that the use of pesticides and fertilizers derived first from guano and then from natural gas allowed [the Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) which allowed much more food to be produced on much less land, allowing more land to return to nature ([this plot](http://imgur.com/YoOmS4E) is for US crop yields, but a similar one would apply to Europe). He says that if the average yields of 1961 were present in 1998, an additional 4.2 billion acres of farmland would be required to feed the world's then 6 billion people, about the area of Russia. And that's just to feed people - until the internal combustion engine became commonplace huge amounts of farm land was needed to feed horses and other draft animals - one third of America's agricultural land was for feeding its then 21 million horses in 1915.  But perhaps the biggest thing to explain this reforestation is the use of coal and gas instead of wood for energy. According to Ridley, during the late 1800s, Britain was creating an amount of energy from coal that would of required 15 million acres of forest to recreate, almost the area of Scotland. I can't find the numbers for today, but it seems likely that Britain would need its area in forests many times over to derive its energy from wood today. While using coal, gas and oil for our energy needs obviously isn't ideal for the environment, it has made it feasible to leave massive areas undisturbed despite our booming population as a species.  Anyway, I found it to be a really interesting book and recommend it.",24

"I wouldn't worry about that. DC and BvS have been getting shat on since day one, for not looking like marvel. Like when the movie first started to be promoted people *always* complained that it looked too gritty and dark and depressing. The opposite of Marvel. (Though it's not really. Maybe only when people want it to be for the sake of argument.)  Then the shots from this movie itself are starting to look like pages cut out from a comic book. I love it, personally, but people complain about that visual style too, all because it doesn't look like Marvel.  Marvel looks to me like an action comedy with a comic-book skin. Dc is looking like a comic book coming to life shot by shot. Both are fine, but pretty distinct.  So the movie styles should be utterly different. Which is good news to me. But not marvel fanboys. Of course it's a catch 22. Marvel fanboys complain not so directly, that BvS looks nothing like the marvel carbon-copy movies that they want, but if it did, they'd scream bloody murder.  Basically all I'm saying is, don't worry about DC movies becoming just like marvels. I think they've already done well in separating themselves from marvel.. and if they did just copy marvel, marvel fanboys would be breaking the Internet.  ",9

"&gt; Male love is sacrificial, generous and largely selfless.  ...you know that's the **beta** version of love right?  Masculine love means you are the **owner** of the situation and demand respect or she gets nexted.  The misbehaving woman is punished ""for the sake of love"" which for a man means him maintaining a position of respect.  But the women who behaves well is given a reward in positive attention.  When a woman Shit Tests it's because she is beginning to doubt your love (dominance) over her and if you do not punish in some way her primal brain ""feels"" a lack of love.  So you must punish to assure her you do care enough to put her in her place.  It's like owning a puppy that misbehaves.  You must punish, but out of love and with equal efforts at other times to praise.  If one never disciplines their puppy (or woman) they become terrible pets that hate you.  At the same time it's important that your punishment is appropriate to the situation so if  she does something insignificant you shouldn't overreact.  Withdrawing approval of her is the most basic punishment.  Ideally you would just give a disapproving look. (assuming she is well behaved otherwise)  &amp;nbsp;",14

"Ok I'm gonna break this down.  1. I don't give a shit about a smile when I'm drunk at 2 am. Just don't look at me like I'm a piece of shit for being out on Whyte on a Friday. 2. No, I don't care about whether you open doors for me or not. 3. Clean cars should be a given. I'm not giving you bonus points for a given. 4. Basically, no personal calls at work. Same basic principle as every other job. So this is another given. 5. No thanks, I don't want gum... Seriously this is the very least of my worries ever in the entire world. 6. Trip refusals. This is the one I'm a little wishy-washy on. I want a driver to be able to refuse trips if they feel physically threatened. But not because it's late and I'm drunk and I look just shifty enough in their eyes to run out on a fare. Or if I'm a crossdresser or my destination is in a neighborhood too far away from the future fares or whatever. 7. Sorry, I would never accept a water bottle from someone I don't know. Also, I couldn't give less of a shit about this if my basic needs for a car-for-hire service aren't being met yet. As /u/FormicaArchonis said, let's get the basics dealt with first, eh? 8. Fuck, no. Just no. I don't care about a rose. You guys aren't getting it. 9. Another given. Basically another way of saying ""Do your job and don't get in to a car accident."" I'm not gonna be blown away by a taxi drivers ability to not crash in to something. That's not what defines top notch service to me. 10. No long conversations about politics or religion? That's almost a given. Unless you're engaged by your customer to really go in-depth about a topic, it's inappropriate to discuss at work.  So let's tally it. 10/10 would mean 100% good valid steps towards positive business growth. No points for givens- that is things that are generally expected and should be provided by a car-for-hire service. We'll say that stuff I don't even consider or care about means no points as well. So... this list of ten new steps gets 1/10. The only point that really even touched on a major issue was trip refusals.  Of course, missing from this list of ten was the most major points that bug us about taxis. Cost, response time, intentional fare-hiking, and payment issues. (Oh, my credit card machine isn't on. Are you sure you don't have cash? You have to wait for it to start up. Do you have cash on you?)  I'm still confused as to whether taxi companies don't understand the issues we have with them, or if they understand the issues but don't want to dedicate the resources to resolving them and would rather try to fool people with a new shiny solution to a problem that isn't really a problem.",13

"My answer from an /r/askscience thread a while back. I wouldn't say it's totally right but you can read on  &gt; I'm paraphrasing [an answer from Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/45098/when-do-3d-random-walks-return-to-their-origin) in a way that will make it more accessible. Let's say you have a random walk in d dimensions. What does it look like when you disregard all but one of the dimensions - you see a 1-d random walk! Since you have d dimensions, we can do this kind of thought experiment for each dimension. So in the end you are really looking at a combination of d one-dimensional random walks (really a ""product"" of sorts). Now, if you are looking at the probability of returning to the origin, in 1 dimension the answer is not that difficult. The answer for d dimensions is really a product of the 1-dimensional probabilities. They are kind of small but for d = 1 and d = 2 they add up to 1 quickly and you find that you return to the original position. When d = 3, they are just small enough that they don't add up to 1, no matter how many steps you allow.  &gt;To be a bit more precise the probability that a 1-d random walks is near the original position after n steps is proportional to n^(-1/2). To find the probability that we'll eventually return you need to sum the probabilities that the walk will return in 1 step, in 2 steps, in 3 steps, ad infinitum. This sum becomes infinite, and so you are sure that you'll eventually return. Now since you are looking at a product of d one-dimensional walks, you expect that the probability of coming back after n steps is going to be proportional to (n^(-1/2))^(d) = n^(-d/2). The sum of these over n is going to be the probability that we'll eventually return.  &gt;When d is 1, you have a sum of 1/sqrt(n) which is infinite p-series with p = 1/2 as I mentioned. When d is 2, you have the sum of 1/n, which is also infinite and we're sure to come back to the origin. However, when d = 3, you have a convergent series and in the end the probability ends up being less that 1. This is more and more true for larger d.  &gt;In a more philosophical sense, there is just too much space to go to in higher dimensions. In 1-dimensional space you can only go left and right. In 2 dimensions you have east, west, north and south and gets just a bit harder to eventually come back but not difficult enough to make it improbable. In 3 dimensions you now have up and down and it's just too much to handle with certainty. This issue becomes even worse in higher dimensions. ",6

BernieBros say they are progressives who want progress. Under a conservative Supreme Court, expect to be taking huge steps backward instead of forward. Expect the conservative Supreme Court to dismantle a lot of the progress that has been made already. Expect the weakening if not outright reversal of precedents like Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges. Kiss goodbye any hope of reversing Citizens United. Expect the Supreme Court to be innately hostile to any progressive policies, making it harder to achieve the progress that is desired.  You're willing to risk all of that, not to mention whatever a Republican White House and Congress would do, simply because you feel the need to express your dislike for one person.

"Why did Beck win AOTY over Beyoncé last year (despite the fact that I enjoy that pick)? It's because the Grammys know what gets people to tune in every year: drama. If K-Dot had won it this year, what would the big drama have been? Meghan Trainor winning best new artist? Nope, the other artists weren't known well enough for that to be a steal (although Courtney Barnett deserved it imo). To be honest, every year the Grammys need to find something for people to talk about afterwards. The sound issue with Adele's performance was accidental, but 1989 winning? I guess that's what they want you to call a #GrammyMoment or whatever. We'll be talking about it for years to come.

"There's been a lot of negativity about Firebird's. I came across a short guide that I found amusing and wanted to share. If the owner from the forum I stole it is on here, and wants to take credit, please do so!   ----  Firebird refresher tips, in case anyone doesn't remember the good old days:  - Be aggressive. always be kiting into new parts of the map, never backwards. The more enemies there are burning, the more damage you deal to each of them, and you need to have AT LEAST like 20 at a time to be doing it right.  - Be aggressive. You've got a potion and two cheat death effects, so you're actually really tanky if you think about it.  - Seriously, if at any time you don't have at least one of your three cheat deaths on cooldown, you're being a bad firebird. If the ""You died"" screen pops up and your purple bar is higher than the little yellow line, that means you're doing a good job. Come to think of it, since the first death doesn't make you sit through a countdown, that's basically a fourth cheat death effect. The key to the 'bird is to go deep and do whatever you want so long as 20 monsters and an elite are on fire.  - Even while you're dead, they still burn.  - They burn even when you're dead.  - It doesn't matter if you're dead, if everyone else is dead.  - You are not burning enough enemies. You are never burning enough enemies.  - Die.  ---  I think, ""It doesn't matter if you're dead, if everyone else is dead,"" is my new motto. Just reached GR73, certainly aided by these wise tips.  You can consider this an advertisement for Firedbird's set.",10

As the Democratic presidential candidate who has delivered speeches to the largest US financial institutions in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars, why are you hesitant to release transcripts or audio/video recordings of those meetings in order to be transparent with the American people guarding the promises and assurances that you have made to the big banks?""  **Clinton:** ""Let me say this: I am happy to release anything I have when everybody else does the same. Every other candidate in this race has given speeches to private groups, including Senator Sanders. But let me get to the heart of your question. I was the candidate who went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the candidate who went to them and said, 'You are wrecking our economy. What you are doing with mortgages is going to bring us down.' I called to end the carried interest loophole for hedge fund managers. I called to reign in CEO pay. I now have the most effective and comprehensive plan to deal with the threats that Wall Street poses and I go further than Senator Sanders does because I want to go after all the other bad actors. The bad actors like hedge funds. The bad actors like AIG the insurance company, like Country Wide Mortgage. I take a back seat to nobody in being very clear about what I will do to make sure Wall Street never crashes Main Street again. And that you can count on.""  **Stacco:** ""Secretary Clinton, I do respect you very much. In fact, only a decade ago, I was a very,very big supporter of yourself and your husband. It actually broke my heart when you said marriage was between a man and a woman. How can we trust that this isn't just more political rhetoric? Please just release those transcripts so that we know exactly where you stand.""  **Clinton:** ""You know where I stand because I've been in public, standing the whole time. But let me say something about this. You know, I, like many Americans, have evolved. And I'm glad I have [evolved]. I am a 100% supporter. I am absolutely adamant about protecting marriage equality. And I think it's significant that the Human Rights Campaign, the leading organization in our country to ensure that the LGBT community has the rights they deserve, have endorsed me. Your candidate said, 'well that's because they're part of the establishment.' Well, with all due respect, they fight against the establishment every single day and I've been with them and I will pass the Equality Act, too.""",40

In 2011 or so he wrote a book called ""The Evolution of Speech"". It has one star from one review on Google books, and has testimonials from all sorts of people who probably are not experts on the evolution of speech (or they'd presumably mention it somewhere).  It got very few reviews, but did get absolutely trashed by the few academics to look at it, which is presumably why Frenkel has such a bat up his butthole about academics.

I fucking lost it. I jumped out of my seat, told him to back the fuck up and stop being an asswipe. I further went on to explain that he placed the first order via an after hours phone call that I wasn't privy to nor did I ever see a record of. And then I also mentioned that even if I knew about the first deal it wouldn't have helped because he did the second deal without telling me that's what he was about to do.

"I'm not going to argue that hot women don't get away with way too much because they're hot.

I can be pretty sure that the only reason I have other attributes, like my good cooking, writing/music talents, or loyalty for example, is that I lived the first 15 years of my life having to fight for people's attention because I WASN'T pretty.  So yeah, you're right about that.  But instead of being angry at women for only providing what they're asked to provide (not saying you specifically are angry, just RP in general) then why not blame the guys who continue to let hot women get away with being ONLY hot?  Tons of guys reward vapid, bitchy women with attention just because they're not...INCLUDING...most likely MOST...RP guys.  None of the RP guys seem particularly invested in girls being nice or smart or interesting.  Maybe if more men rewarded those traits (in addition to a girl meeting physical thressholds) then hot women wouldn't think they could get away with murder.  Interestingly, this isn't so far off from the ""women should stop complaining about guys being douches when they keep choosing hot douches and rewarding their shitty behavior"" argument.",8

"I'm gonna make the argument here so it doesn't get buried.   I don't think Matthews is bias towards a specific candidate. I think he just talks aloud and his rough with his guests, particularly when they're members of a campaign.   I remember so vividly in 2008 at times it seemed like he was the biggest Obama hater, when in fact he has proven to be (and after the primary and election, proved to be) his biggest fan.   He just calls it like he sees it. When Bernie has a good week (like he did last week), Matthews will praise him (like he did so eloquently on Tuesday night), and when Bernie has a bad week, he'll rip him.   He is an old school guy so his perspective on politics might be more accustomed to the Clinton way of doing things. But, as a Sanders supporter, I do roll my eyes sometimes when this sub goes so vociferously against him like its a personal vendetta or a systematic bias. I feel like that contributes to people reacting to Sanders with hostility.   I guarantee you that as Sanders pulls off more wins and comes into his own more and his message spreads, so too will Matthews' praise of him (even if his personal politics might be in some disagreement). And if I'm wrong, I'll eat my words and donate more money to the Sanders campaign. ",202

"I didn't hate it but i didn't enjoy it either. The best thing i can say about it is that it's a perfect adaptation of the Deadpool comic, of which i'm not that much a fan of. Bare in mind i'm not judging the movie on how well it was adapted, just what i saw on screen.  The action was good, but at times it was a bit too reliant on CG. The biggest problem i have with the movie is that i just find the character of Deadpool and his humour a bit exhausting. There were certainly funny jokes, but the quips per minute ratio was far far too high for my liking. And i really can't stand his meta-ness. Pointing out your flaws doesn't mean they are null and void. Case in point, saying the movie stars a ""British villain"" and ""a hot chick"" doesn't mean its not valid to criticise the fact that his girlfriend was a walking talking cliche and the villain was a moustache-twirling British villain who can't feel pain with shit, capitalist motivations.   A lot of people will love this movie, and that's fine.

"My mother, too, liked to overshare about sex. About how she and Dad once had a 17-hour marathon fuckfest. All to help Dad break a fever. (This is *her* story; I'm just relating it.)   And the time (I've posted on Reddit about this before,) she allowed my 7yo brother and myself (12 at the time) to watch a hardcore XXX-rated video for a college class she was taking. (To be clear, it was part of her assignment to watch the video; she was one of those ""nothing about sex should be shameful or hidden"" type folks, which in a sense is true, but in another, more important sense, doesn't mean showing hardcore porn to your kids.)   Edit: About the porn -- this was in NY around 1982 or so. My mother had gone back to college and as an elective had taken a human sexuality course. One of the course requirements was that you had to have 3 new sexual experiences during that semester and then write about it. It could be anything, a new fantasy, whatever. Since she'd never seen an X-rated movie, and the VCR was absolutely revolutionizing people's consumption of porn at the time, she decided to rent a movie and watch it. She was big on not hiding this kind of thing from the kids; Playboy was relatively available in the house and we were encouraged to ask questions. She made it clear that if we wanted to watch, we could. She didn't require it. I was, now that I look back at it and do the math, I realize that I was 16 and my brother actually 11 when this went down. In my memory we were younger, but I remember the title of the movie and IMDB confirms the year.   So, 16 for me isn't too bad. 11 for my brother? Probably not a great idea. IIRC, the only reason he wanted to watch was because his big brother wanted to watch, and really -- in 1982, what 16yo was going to turn down the chance to watch porn? I didn't watch the whole thing; I remember finding it more amusing than arousing. ",701

"This is a complex answer.  The game economy is complex, and it's not 100% bot's adding items - usually. So although the bot may impact pricing somewhat, the price is normalized and both players and bot's are putting up items at ~that value.  When you rip items out of the economy, you risk upsetting the balance that has been achieved, which can hurt everyone in the long run - and then there are items that have been already purchased.  In short: Yes, it is feasible to do this. But the question remains open to debate: Does it cause more harm then good to the overall server to rip those items out of existence?",7

"Hi Lacy! That's really great that you're being honest and willing to get help and that you've got someone who is being supportive. I think you will probably do really well with therapy.  I'm making my own throwaway here because some of this sounded like stuff I used to do. It has made me feel better to see other people saying they've done similar stuff, so I thought I would add my story as well because at times I have also found myself trying to make injuries worse without really knowing why.  I cut myself for a long time, but I always went to great lengths to hide it and never sought any sort of attention for it. I literally did it for a decade before I ever spoke to anyone out loud about it. For me that was totally different than other injuries.  At times I would try to hurt myself ""accidentally."" I sprained my ankle once, which was genuinely a complete accident (came at a really inconvenient time, too) but after it happened I kept injuring my ankle more to delay healing and then trying to sprain it again. Other times I intentionally let myself faint (note: I never actually faked fainting, they were real faints but I let them happen), made myself catch an illness, let myself have some nasty falls, and similar things.  The weird thing is that a lot of times I wouldn't tell anyone about my injury. Plenty of those fainting spells happened with no one else around, for instance, and then when I did faint with other people around I was extremely uncomfortable with the attention and would deflect it as soon as I could. It was like I liked the idea of attention more than the reality of it.  I saw some comments about Munchhausen's By Proxy on the last post being a potential problem and while I can't speak for anyone else, having my own slight Munchhausen's issues has in no way ever made me even think about doing that to anyone else. That's a whole other realm of behavior to me even if it does involve some similar symptoms.  I really, really hated myself for feigning illness, but I've learned to forgive myself. I was always afraid of being called attention-seeking because there is such a stigma about that, especially for women, but people do need some attention, that's just how we are, and while there are definitely bad ways of trying to get attention, needing attention doesn't make someone a bad person.   In my case I was the oldest of a large, conservative, homeschooling family. My parents talk about how as a baby I got more attention than any of my siblings, and I'm sure that's true given that I was the first, but as I got older I was expected to set an example to all my younger siblings. I wasn't supposed to need anything because I was the oldest. I was mostly left to teach myself because the younger ones needed my mom's attention more in their schoolwork. And not only was I the oldest, but out of the older kids I was the only girl so I feel like I got stuck watching the younger kids a lot more than any of my brothers. I was almost like another parent to my youngest siblings. I remember multiple times where I was upset about something and I was told that I was too old to get upset (even if I was only 10) and reminded that we had actual babies in the house.  I was very depressed, started self-harming very early, and developed a fairly serious eating disorder, all of which I hid for years until in my early 20's I finally ended up hospitalized for the eating disorder. My parents didn't believe in mental illness as anything but a spiritual problem, so even though (they say now) they knew what was going on, they never got me any help.  I kind of wonder if part of my desire to have a physical issue was because I did have real issues that probably did need attention, but I knew that a purely physical issue was the only way I could get sympathy.  Sometimes, too, I was covering up my problems with a physical issue. It's hard to explain to people that the reason I could barely walk was that I hadn't eaten in a week, so a sprained ankle or a recent illness provided a better excuse. I guess I could have just lied about it, but I wouldn't do that. Somehow making myself sprain my ankle seemed better to me than outright lying about having a sprained ankle.  I did fantasize about having an illness that would garner me lots of sympathy and attention, but like I said, I was uncomfortable with the reality of receiving attention so I never went that far.  I still don't know exactly why I did what I did, but my point is that I've learned to be gentle with myself. Maybe I was attention-seeking, but I can forgive myself for that. After all, it's possible that I actually did need attention.  It was easier at first for me to feel sympathetic to other attention seekers while I still reviled myself. I remember reading online somewhere (it might have been reddit) about paramedics who deal with patients who fake seizures and other medical issues for attention. Most people were criticizing the patients and saying how awful they were until one paramedic told a story about a girl he used to see regularly who would fake seizures and how annoyed he was about her until he found out that she was living with a stepdad who would sexually abuse her and faking seizures was how she would get herself out of the situation.  That's obviously an extreme case and I have never personally dealt with anything that bad, but it made me realize how judgmental I had been of attention-seekers, *especially myself*, when I really didn't understand what might make someone do what they do. It was a while before I was able to forgive myself, but feeling compassion for other people helped me eventually start to apply some of that compassion to myself.  I am in mental health treatment now. I actually did do some real, unintentional, damage to my heart with an eating disorder (funny how I would try to have other physical problems but assumed that my eating behaviors would never hurt me) and had to be hospitalized for that, but I'm in excellent physical health now and am just working on my mental health. I've found that as I've been going through treatment that desire to seek attention has completely vanished. I still worry I might be doing the same thing with mental health conditions, but I talk with my treatment providers about that and they've pointed out that even thought they really don't think that's what I'm doing, if I were doing it that would be reason enough for treatment in itself, so no matter what I do need and deserve treatment.  Anyway, I wanted to reiterate that I'm really happy to see this update and I wish OP and Lacy the best. I think OP's support and Lacy's honesty and willingness to look at her own problems is absolutely excellent and a good sign of things to come.",374

"They didn't make it a diversity issue, though.  They made it a black issue. It took Ali G to point out the lack of nominated Asians, Latinos, Indians, etc.  Hispanic/Latino make up 17% of the population.  African Americans make up 13%.  Minorities are a minority in film.  We don't hear about the lack of Oscar winning Latinos... Maybe because best director has gone to a Mexican two years in a row?   It's the same thing that made me uncomfortable about the SNL controversy a couple years ago where they complained about the lack of black women represented in the show.  What about Asian?  Latinos?  Trans?   Should everyone be equally represented in a comedy show?     I get the need for diversity, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some backlash about how hyper focused this controversy in on one aspect of diversity.  They ended the show with ""Fight the Power"".

"&gt;I'm kind of curious, do most people miss karma or not? I never liked the karma system, as it could never take into account the nuance of different situations or decisions.  Karma as a numbered ""Good"" or ""Evil"" slider is pretty sucky. I don't inherently mind a karma system, but make it invisible. *Show* me the effects of my actions in the world, not as a number on my sidebar. IF I do some reprehensible shit, make it so certain people will never forgive me, make it so certain raiders respect me, even fear me. After a certain point maybe people will simply lay down arms once they realize who I am, and run. Block me from certain paths, open up new paths. Make it so I can't simply give a homeless guy 1600000 bottles of purified water and suddenly I'm a god among men with everyone kneeling before me, past crimes forgotten.

"When someone conveys that they've had an unspeakably traumatic childhood, and staring at a picture of themselves at the age of their abuse, says ""People are gonna be staring at you from across the room and you're gonna have no idea why..."", I don't think it's unfair to assume that ongoing molestation, physical abuse in relation to it, and even blame/feigned ignorance from others is what's being danced around.

Moreover, in GitHub's case, they're hosting all of these sites for free, so it seems like it would behoove them to reduce unnecessary processing load.  As an end user, I like to be able to reload my site when a file changes (live previewing and whatnot) rather than waiting several seconds for a few hundred pages to be generated.

"**A lot of people seem to think that to improve at this game you need to try harder, and if you keep trying harder every game you'll get better. Improving at league is usually more about getting rid of bad habits.**  Surprisingly, i jumped from gold 1 to diamond 5 in the space of about two weeks not because i tried harder, but because I got lazy.  Here's the story:  I main jungle. **My main problem had been falling behind in exp and gold when my ganks go poorly in the early game.** I got fed up with trying really hard to help my lanes only to become useless for the rest of the game because I fell so far behind. This went on for the better part of a year.  **To avoid this situation, I decided that every game I would spend:**  * The first 2 minutes of the game farming my jungle.  * The next 2 minutes I would try to gank lanes, and then  * The last minute before my buffs respawned putting down wards.  These specifics aren't particularly important unless you happen to main jungle and have the same problems I did. **What is important is that I deliberately made a significant change to how I was playing league of legends. The significance of the change meant the effects it had on my gameplay easy to identify. This made it easier to understand the mistakes I had been making in the past and avoid them.**  Here are some ideas for meaningful changes:  For jungle:  * Buy a hunter's potion and a pink ward if you have 325g. Next time the enemy jungler ganks top lane, try to solo dragon.  For laning:  * Make staying alive your priority above all else. Do not trade your life for an enemy's if you have the option to run away and live.  * Focus on getting as much CS as you can and avoiding poke damage. Dont spend time harassing your lane opponent if it means you will lose farm.  General gameplay:  * If you are a skillshot based champion, like morgana, save your skillshots for when the enemy ADC is going to CS a minion. This raises the chances of you landing the skillshot since they are focusing on something else.  * Make a habit of target pinging or on my way pinging before you engage on any enemy, ever. You'll notice your team is much more likely to follow up on your engages.  * Once the game has begun, make sure every time you leave fountain you have a pink ward in your inventory, even if it means giving up an extra amplifying tome.  * If you want to make a play, find a specific reason to do it, and adjust the size/scope of your play based on the advantage you're trying to exploit. Examples:           Enemy laner burning an important regular spell (blitzcrank hook) can justify a short trade.          Enemy jungler showing top can justify an all in if you are winning lane.          Enemy flash being down can justify flash engages because you're much more likely to be able to kill them.  **It is important to limit the amount of changes being made at the same time so that you can understand the changes in your games and turn that data into useful knowledge.**  For example, if you decide to focus on CSing over harassment during laning phase, you could also make sure you leave the fountain with a pink ward. These two changes dont really conflict with each other. Both are likely to help you lower the number of times you die during the laning phase.  On the other hand, it would be bad to focus on CSing while also trying to go for trades based on your opponent's cooldowns. The two concepts are sort of opposites, and this will make it hard to do both at once, much less understand how each affects your gameplay and results individually if you combine them.",9
"For those that want some context...  People have been using [SWBStats.com](http://swbstats.com/) to gauge player population. Recently, EA held a [community challenge](http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront/news/daily-challenge-community-mission) for the playerbase to complete 3,000,000 daily challenges in 6/7 days to celebrate the introduction of daily challenges in their recent patch. Each player gets one daily challenge a day.  So people were looking at SWBStats and were doubting it would be possible. It turns out the community challenge was completed, supposedly thanks to [weekend players](https://twitter.com/sledgehammer70/status/696728393690132480). Of course, some people are speculating that the community challenge was never complete and they said it was completed just to make the game look better/avoid the game looking like it's dying.  It's important to note that SWBStats only displays **current** players and 24h peaks. It does not display the amount of **unique** players every day.  They are also apparently, as the OP states, claiming SWBStats shows incorrect information. So whether SWBStats is displaying less or more current/24h peak players is irrelevant, because we simply don't know how many unique players are playing every day. It's all speculation.",13

"The reality is actually far more complicated. As soon as Allende got into power, Nixon decided that America had to make Chile's economy ""scream"". Allende's unpopularity was not his own fault - it was a careful manipulation of Chile's economy by American corporate interests (esp. in the copper industry), and a testament to how dangerously powerful this country is and how cruelly it can destroy progressive movements around the world if they dare cut into the corporations' profits. If you want some good, detailed reading about this, here you go:   * http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/poli/soa/chile.htm * http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/10/40_years_after_chiles_9_11 * http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm * http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/ChomskyOdonian_Chile.html     * ""Kissinger said he was concerned that the success of social democracy in Chile would be contagious. It would infect southern Europe-southern Italy, for example-and would lead to the possible success of what was then called Eurocommunism (meaning that Communist parties would hook up with social democratic parties in a united front). Actually, the Kremlin was just as much opposed to Eurocommunism as Kissinger was, but this gives you a very clear picture of what the domino theory is all about. Even Kissinger, mad as he is, didn't believe that Chilean armies were going to descend on Rome. It wasn't going to be that kind of an influence. He was worried that successful economic development, where the economy produces benefits for the general population-not just profits for private corporations-would have a contagious effect. In those comments, Kissinger revealed the basic story of US foreign policy for decades."" * http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/chile-coup-pinochet-allende   Overthrowing him and replacing him with a brutal fascist dictatorship goes to show exactly how little America and the CIA actually cared about his unpopularity or Chileans' opinions.

"**Big Battlesuits**  For the below analysis I will be ignoring Hazard suits Riptides, Riptide variants, and the larger varieties of [MechaGodzillas](http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/en-WW/Tau-KX139-Ta'unar-Supremacy-Armour). As well I will be ignoring Dreadnoughts, Dreadknights, and other big Astartes things.  **Armour:**  In terms of taking damage Tau Battlesuit Armour is comparable to Astartes Power Armour.   &gt; When it comes to deflecting and withstanding damage, the XV8's armour is comparable to the ceramite used by the Imperium of Man's Space Marines, but weighs substantially less.  [Crisis Battlesuit](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/XV8_Crisis_Battlesuit)  &gt; As such, the suits are rated as providing as much protection for their pilots as a suit of Space Marine Terminator Armour.  [Broadside armour](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/XV88_Broadside_Battlesuit) provides the same protection as Terminator armour.  &gt; However, the XV25 provides little protection against large-calibre small arms such as Astartes bolters.  [Stealth Battlesuit](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Stealth_Battlesuit)   **Melee Armament:**  Astartes win by default. Tau have only a couple of melee weapons, and they are not common. Tau prefer to use mobility and range to avoid melee.  **Ranged Armament:**  This is where things get messy. I don't have any good sources putting one above the other, or even a certain Astartes weapon above a certain Tau weapon. The basic bolter is comparable to the pulse rifle, which Tau Battlesuits don't bother using since they have better weapons. However bolters can use a variety of ammos which can change the whole dynamic, plus Astartes can carry many types of weapons. Likewise Tau Battlesuits have a variety of weapons that also change things.  In general, Tau Battlesuits [normally](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Crisis_Battlesuit#Sept_Armament_Variations) carry weapons that melt or perforate Astartes, while Astartes generally carry weapons that Tau Battlesuits [ignore](http://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/678367.page#8418609). However both can easily change the weapons they carry.  **Mobility**  This is where Tau Battlesuits start to shine. Only Broadsides are not equipped with jetpacks, and they are really more comparable to Terminators, who are also slow. Crisis suits however are all equipped with jetpacks, compared to only a few astartes carrying them. [Some](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Crisis_Battlesuit#XV86_Coldstar_Battlesuit) Tau Battlesuits are even capable of joining dogfights and flying into space  It should be noted though, Astartes have [other](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Land_Raider) means of transportation.  **Size**  Crisis Battlesuits stand about half a meter or a foot and half above an Astartes.  &gt; the Space Marine's skeleton will be larger and exponentially stronger than a normal man's with growth having topped out at around 7-7.5 feet in height with an equivalent amount of skeleto-muscular mass  [Space Marine](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Marines)  &gt; Tau Battlesuit Height 2.8 metres  [Crisis Battlesuit](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/XV8_Crisis_Battlesuit)  **Numbers and Production**  Tau Battlesuits are limited to experienced Firewarriors, [Battlesuit Pilot Progression](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/XV8_Crisis_Battlesuit#Battlesuit_Pilot_Progression). However all battlesuits are mass-produced. The Tau likely have millions (Example: If 1 in 10 firewarriors survive to obtain a battlesuit), and can replace them if lost.  Estimate on Astartes numbers are that the Imperium have about 1 million spread across about 1000 chapters. In addition they struggle to replace some of their equipment [Terminator Armour](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Terminator_Armour).  **Role in Battle**  This is the largest difference between them and why the above comparisons aren't particularly useful unless you create a situation where they are facing each other.  Tau Battlesuits on the other hand tend to be spread out to each Hunter Cadre. Almost every Hunter Cadre will have multiple battlesuits, of a variety of types. Astartes tend to operate independently of the Imperial Guard. Remaining as a ""large"" rapidly deployed strike force. This gives them significant force concentration.  Because of this difference it is virtually never something like 100 Astartes vs 100 Crisis Battlesuits, setup 1 km apart, on open ground. Instead it would be more like 10 crisis battlesuits and 100 firewarriors vs 25 Astartes in ruined buildings, with Guard regiments and additional Hunter Cadres in the area.  **Summary:**  In general Tau Battlesuits are larger, more mobile, have comparable armour, better ranged weapons, worse melee weapons, easily replaced, and are more spread out in a war. However a [specific situation](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/O'Shovah) can easily turn that around.",33

"&gt; On 1807 when Napoleon and Czar Alexandr I met at Tilsit (East Prussia, now part of Russia), virtually all of Europe was under Napoleon's thumb.  &gt; He cntrolled most of Central Europe, and most of the rest save England were his allies at least nominally. Even the USA was leaning towards him.  &gt; Yet within 8 years the ancien regime returned in triumph, and set back everything to 1788, before the revolution, because Napoleon had no means to destroy the island country.  &gt; -----  &gt; On December 2010, KPop had at least 25 major acts with at least 120 members. All the soloists remaining were now no longer able to do much against the onslaught of boy and girl groups, which were busy conquering the world.  &gt; There was only one soloist of note, Lee Jieun, who was just a junior in a high school. It seemed the genre of soloist and the genre of vocalist had passed into the dustbin of history.  &gt; Fast forward 4 years, and IU, the only soloist of note on Dec 2010, was voted as the most popular singer of Korea by Gallup, which also featured 3 other older soloists and only 5 groups in the top 10.  &gt; IU, who already took No.1 song on 2011, took No.1 song title as well, with a song written by Kim Changwan on....  &gt; 1984.  &gt; That's right. IU made a 1984 song the most popular number on the year 2014.  &gt; It is even more unfortunate that IU's style of music is not something palatable to overseas fans, the foundation of KPop around the world.  &gt; IU follows a simple, easy-to-listen acoustic stylle of music, something which could easily be performed by a single acoustic guitar.  &gt; IU also put a self-composed song, Friday, to the top of the chart. Friday is no dance number ; it can be played by anyone who can play guitar, and is never really going to be popular around the world.  &gt; But that has set a bad example to idols who are releasing more and more acoustic style of songs, which fit the Korean digital market but do not sell to the foreigners, who have their own singers who can do such kind of music.  &gt; KPop became popular around the world because it offered something the other countries did not do, but the Koreans chose to revert back to the style of music popular on late 1970s and early 1980s.  &gt; Thanks to IU, the C'est si bon people (a bunch of folk singers who were popular from 1970 to 1975, when all of them were jailed by the orders of President Park Chung Hee, whose daughter is the current Korean President Park Geun Hye) became relevant again. They are now in their late 60s and 70s but they frequently holding shows of their own with guitars, catered to older Koreans but not to foreigners who do not care about that kind of music.   &gt; IU made the acoustic style the mainstream of Korean pop music, and drove the foreign fans away from KPop.  &gt; And that kind of music influenced people like Sunmi, Jung Eunji, and even Amber (who is not Korean) to some degree! And as IU continues to linger at the top, such kind of useless-for-foreigners music will be only more prevalent, which will not bide well to KPop fans around the world.  &gt; Acoustic style of music is easy to perform and easy on Korean ears. Also that kind of songs do not require hard dance practices.  &gt; But they will never win any sizable fans out of Korea where the money is.  &gt; IU set back KPop by at least 30 years, and the damage caused by her to KPop is unlikely to be repaired... It cannot be denied that IU was more hell-bent on destroying KPop than the aforementioned Ran was insistent on catching Jack. IU, a very ambitious and greedy person, would stop at nothing, even though she certainly knew her actions were going to crush KPop.  &gt; I understand that to truly liberate KPop so it could rise again, the evil giant Loen/Melon has to break. No entity has done more harm to KPop than Loen. Virtually everything Melon/Loen does harms KPop.  &gt; Still, if Kpop could be freed from the yoke of IU, those who emulate her will leave and KPop could rise again.  &gt; I still do not understand why the various KPop stars did their best to crush IU once for all after Anchovy. Perhaps they feared the wrath of Melon; but Samsung, no friend of Melon, has Genie service and there are others, so if the big companies told their fans to shun Melon and go to another company, Melon's destructive power would have been reduced.  &gt; Unless KPop can break IU's yoke, KPop cannot rise again.",13

"Holy fuck! Grrrr.  Now in cases of severe dehydration we give water but grrr.    For anyone reading this yes, your ""milk"" doesn't come in for several days post birth there are actually three stages of breast milk production! Colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk. It's a coming misconception especially among Latina families that the ""first milk""  (Colostrum)  is ""no good""  and you have to bottle or ""top up with water""  until the ""real""  milk comes in.    THIS IS FALSE!   Here is more about the three stages of milk and how they are important:  Colostrum is the first stage of breast milk. It occurs during pregnancy and lasts for several days after the birth of the baby. It is either yellowish or creamy in color. It is also much thicker than the milk that is produced later in breastfeeding.  Colostrum is high in protein, fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are antibodies that pass from the mother to the baby and provide passive immunity for the baby. Passive immunity protects the baby from a wide variety of bacterial and viral illnesses. Two to four days after birth, colostrum will be replaced by transitional milk.  Transitional milk  Transitional milk occurs after colostrum and lasts for approximately two weeks. The content of transitional milk includes high levels of fat, lactose, and water-soluble vitamins.  It contains more calories than colostrum.  Mature milk  Mature milk is the final milk that is produced. 90% of it is water, which is necessary to keep the infant hydrated. The other 10% is comprised of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats which are necessary for both growth and energy.  There are two types of mature milk:  Foremilk: This type of milk is found during the beginning of the feeding and contains water, vitamins, and protein.  Hind-milk: This type of milk occurs after the initial release of milk. It contains higher levels of fat, and is necessary for weight gain.  Both foremilk and hind-milk are necessary when breastfeeding to ensure the baby is receiving adequate nutrition to grow and develop properly.

"As a Teacher I would like to add a few things that could help.  Speak with your teacher after class, ask them what you can do to do well in their course.

(it is also generally liked when students take special interest and show effort which could potentially boost your mark depending on the subject)  participate in class- if you answer a question wrong, you likely wont forget it. it will always be easier to recall information when you have relayed it with a group or infront of the class.  be thorough and have the teacher explain anything to you you may not understand, it is the easiest way to not fall behind.  use your notes and class materials, make a study group. get together outside of class time and relay thoughts, ideas and information to each other.",6

Sheldon popped in because he was frustrated with the situation and absolutely nobody was answering us. I don't support Sheldon going into the channel like that, so I'm sorry if he did.  The other point I want to address is that I did not ask why you called timeout. I asked if you called a timeout due to lag. I remember it because there was a point behind my question and that was to determine your motives behind the timeout. You absolutely should have been prepared for a sub and there's no excuse for not being prepared. I want to give you the benefit of the doubt but I asked if the reason was for lag at least a dozen times. The questions were direct. The answers were not until you answered me at the end.  If you truly did call the timeout due to lag, then you should have been much, much more forth-write in your doing so. The fact that your entire team was dodging that question in unacceptable. Not to mention honestly Randy should have been calling time then or (and this is what should have happened) typed in team chat that he needed a sub and you should have jumped in or you wait until the momentum shift has changed before you call time out.  If you are indeed telling the truth but I really doubt it in all sincerity, too much circumstantial evidence pointing in the opposite direction, then I hope this serves as a lesson to you that you should be more direct when your decisions affect another party and the fact that this is the first I hear from your team irks me to no end. This explanation is long overdue and had it came last night I would have believed you. It's just not right. ",6

So please, if you ever see a fight that fits these criteria and you would like to see for Team Fight Breakdown, tweet me @RiotJatt, or our editor @willcamacho3 and we WILL check it out.

"Speaking as a December 2014 Mizzou alum (a whole year before this shit started), a lot of us in this community had no idea this shit was lurking beneath the surface. People like me, moderate liberals, are just now waking up and being made aware that the SJWs of the internet are starting rear their head in the real world. Those here who are GG veterans have been following this sort of ideology for a while, so I'm sure a lot of these ideas coming out of the activist camp are nothing new or surprising.  It's been really disappointing for this community as a whole, because Mizzou and Columbia are synonymous in a lot of ways, as the University is the largest job provider in town. Just a year before these protests our community came together to stand with Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to enter the NFL draft, we stood with him against the protests of the Westboro Baptist Church. Only to turn around a year later to be told we are not progressive enough. It's just so maddening and sad. This shit is going to have real economic consequences for our community.  Also, I have an English degree, and can say for the most part that these forms of sociological theory are really hidden away and are only exposed if you really pursue those courses. Of the signees of the petition in support of Click, I had two of them, one of which is the department chair of English. It's really disappointing, as these are two individuals I know for a fact are very knowledgeable in their areas of expertise. It's upsetting to see people I respected, learned from, and discussed lofty ideas and classic literature with act in such a politically misguided manner.  I'm kind of rambling at this point, but this is an issue that is very dear to me and my home. Many here are relieved that Click is finally gone; I for one am sick of seeing her and that video in the local news every fucking day. Mizzou had no potential of healing as long as an overt symbol of infringing upon fundemental constitutional rights was retained on the payroll.  This whole situation really opened my eyes to the divisiveness of identity politics. I just want us all to be friends, why does either side have to resort to hatred? It's easy to dismiss it from the right, but many liberals like me just feel so betrayed.  You better believe I'm starting to speak up. The people in my life know exactly how I feel, and I have facts and logic to back my opinions up. ",7

Three months after moving into a new apartment complex we had a bedbug infestation on our hands.  The complex treated (heat treatment) the first infestation, and made us pay the bill via installments as a rent add-on.  &gt;  &gt; Originally the complex said they had a warranty from the pest control company, but now the same bed bug infestation is back - it just moved to a different room in the apartment.  My husband and I were told today that the warranty only covered the work for 30 days. After the first treatment they gave us the ""all clear,"" but now the bugs are back.   &gt;  &gt; The owner of the complex is blaming us for this infestation and forcing us to pay the whole treatment bill within 10 days or will we will be evicted.  If we surrender the property, the manager will give us 30 days to move out.  Either way, we have to find a new apartment.

"In the first times, champions were some classic concepts that you can see in other games. Fighter, burst mage, control mage, assassin, etc. The only true supportive champion in the game was Soraka. Others were much like ""this champion can do good stuff to a team mate"". For example Alistar or Blitzcrank were jungle. Morgana was mid. Stuff like that.

"Basically making a big stink in some areas of gaming. Like dead or alive game isn't coming to America anymore because they complained the game was too sexist against women while ignoring that the men in the game are all shirtless, buff and in thong type underwear.  That is one I can think off the top of my head. Nobody would have given a shit in like the year 2000 or something when the first beach volleyball game came out and people played it regardless of your gender.  Also recentally they're getting angry about a video game character named Tifa, from ff7, a game that came out in the 90's. Seems a lot of hate and anger just because guys found it attractive back in the day. There was also the tomb raider reboot and how some of them called it torture porn.    The only impact the gaming industry is facing is censorship. Think Nintendo recently changed one of their characters from a Indian style clothing to more of a cowboy look in America to not offend people over here, regardless that her character in the previous game wore the same Indian outfit. It's kinda of a hot bed in gaming now that developers want to be PC to not get backlash which of course causes backlash.  Not sure what they said about the witcher 3 but seeing how it's mostly white people in the game and sex scenes with a lot of topless women I can't imagine anything good.  Same people that bitched to Joss Weadon about the black widow in avengers 2 and got angry at the rape scene in game of thrones recentally with one of the main characters that we watch grow.  Reminds me of the 90's actually and how they tried to censor rap and south park.",8

"1: This sounds like a composition fallacy:  expecting an unknown thing to be similar to a known thing.  Being an atheist doesn't make me feel any kind of way.  No more than being right-handed or having toes does.  My life does not contain an analog to the role religion plays in your life.  It's kinda like finding out someone doesn't watch the sport you like, and you asking ""well what sport *do* you like?"". Maybe I don't watch any sport, but it doesn't mean that there is a gap that needs to be filled by something similar.  I get fulfillment in many ways, like most people.  It's just that for me, religion isn't one of the ways.  2:  I do not proselytize.  Existence is a complex thing, and I don't claim that my way of doing it is so important that it overrides your right to do it your way.  By that same token, though, I don't excuse people who think their religion is so important that they need to breach etiquette by trying to tell me *my* way is wrong.  You can't see the world through my eyes, so you can't determine what I should do, even if your holy book tells you to.  It's rude, and your belief (not you specifically, just generally) doesn't justify your rudeness.  3:  The composition fallacy again.  Atheism doesn't ""do"" anything, nor should it.  Maybe I get value from collecting old Pogo Possum comics.  It wouldn't make sense for me to ask ""what does not collecting Pogo do for you?""",74

"Right by all counts. I've repeated the same thoughts many times now over 2015.  Arena Net has enough professionalism to realize they currently don't have the experience to make underwater as enjoyable as land combat, even if other players don't have the insight to see that.  It only makes sense to put it on the back-burner and accumulate data while working on more pressing matters.  One notable example of a step forward is Gliding. As they weave more gliding into future maps and even combat, that is sure to contribute to the eventual overhaul of underwater.   *Personally, I'm thinking aqua-jets for finer motion control.*",14

There might have been more, but my point is that I love that she's finally having trouble with the way she's been for so long. It was such a great idea by the writers to put her and Morgan up against each other to find some kind of balance in between.

"&gt;We can agree on that. I'm not anti-gun. I own a gun for recreation. But I'm heavily against citizens escalating non-deadly situations and taking the first shot, because that's when people start dying. Deescalate until all options are exhausted before firing.  As soon as a gun is involved in a robbery, it is officially classed as a deadly situation by nearly any law enforcement agency in the United States. That's not done because the cops are brain-dead powertrips; it's done because *guns are deadly.* If an armed suspect points his gun at *anyone*, it is well within the right of any LEO to use lethal force to take them down as quickly as necessary before they fire on a presumably innocent person.  If no LEO is available, why shouldn't someone who had a permit to carry be barred from exercising their legal right to self-defense (which includes the defense of others in immediate, life-thrratening danger)? It's not vigilantism to attempt to save the life of another person if it means taking the life of someone who is a threat. And this is coming from someone who very much dislikes guys in any capacity.

"Accountability starts at administration, unfortunately there are so so many corrupt and crooked and ""old school"" administrations still left in this country.

Many departments don't have these issues and work like a competent business should (well, as competent as and government organization can run lol) but it's the small percentage of departments (often the largest and therefore most noticeable) that highlight the worst case scenerios.  Fun fact about Pennsylvania law enforcement, it was considered so corrupt decades ago because they would literally go to immigrant docks on the east coast and hire the biggest immigrants that just got off the boats to be police officers. These guys didn't speak much English and were fairly stupid or brutal and didn't know anything about a fair wage. Because of his practice, most states west of Pennsylvania and south of New England have a separation of powers at the state level to ensure that corruption isn't absolute. For example, Pennsylvania's state police have jurisdiction for any crime throughout the entire state whereas in Ohio they have the state highway patrol (governors bodyguards and traffic/accident specialists) and sheriff departments (courts/jails/warrants/rural patrol).

"Sibyl only works because they're a completely independent nation. If Sibyl has to admit that their food supply was imperfect and they begin having to trade with other nations that means that they were an imperfect system to begin with. Not only that, but having to trade with other nations means they're no longer autonomous, and to trade with other nations would likely require some form of immigration to be necessary, or at least that's what makishima believes. The immigration is a big deal for sibyl, if a lot of immigration happens (judging by the condition of the outside world, it would) then sibyl slows down because they have so many more people to check, and people with no past history within the system. This makes the sibyl system much more strained and difficult to maintain, meaning more accidents happen and people's belief in sibyl crumbles more and more. ",7
"You guys are getting there. I think [this sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlaL9OhZQoc&amp;t=6m0s) sums up the pinnacle of 90's Bulls basketball, at least for me. 92 finals. Pip gets the steal and leads the break which MJ punctuates with the put back slam. Chicago Stadium is hype. Quick cut to Rick Adleman clearly thinkin ""hmm this doesn't bode well"". The Blazers bring it up and the Glyde falls victim to the moment and chucks an airball just further fueling the rabid crowd. Paxson brings it up and finds MJ who walks into the 3. You can feel the air being sucked out of Chicago Stadium as the ball is in the air. Michael's 6th 3  drops and the roof blows the fuck off the building. Mike gives the shrug and the quintessential 90's jock jam plays us into the timeout break.

Pretend testosterone is like a letter that has the message ""hey bro grow some manbeards"", and the hair follicles in your face have mailboxes specifically reserved for receiving mail from sender=testosterone. Due to genetics, some of your hair follicle cells were built from blueprints that specified having lots of testosterone mailboxes, and others from blueprints that specified no testosterone mailboxes at all.  Some people have lots of those mailboxes in the cells on their face, but they don't produce a lot of testosterone (i.e. due to sex differences). They don't grow facial hair, until they start taking testosterone from an external source and all the cells get the message to grow some manbeards. Other people have face hair cells that just don't have a lot of testosterone mailboxes, so no matter how much testosterone they take, the cells don't get the message and continue to output some weak, fuzzy shit.",6

Is it now legal to open them because they are from the suspected terrorist?  It would likely be seized and opened as evidence. Well that's what happened. Only the letter is their phone and it has Apple security that has supposedly thus far thwarted the minds of the fbi.   As the general consensus serves, the fbi essentially wants Apple to give them a key to the lock. But that's the thing. It isn't a lock. It is layers of programming designed not to be opened, save for the user passcode entry. To have a backdoor into the computer programming, it requires essentially opening new areas of access. This only lessens the security of the phone. The phone also happens to be where we store huge amounts of personal information, location data, etc. ",12

"&gt;How can we even begin to bridge the gap and establish a dialogue between the communities when the LGBT community is so hurt and unwilling to listen?  Bridging the gap is unlikely to happen because the LGBT community has been screwed over, mistreated, and deeply hurt by Christians time and time again.  That leaves a certain gulf that is hard to overcome.  There's a huge difference in stakes for Christians and LGBT folks here.  What LGBT people think about Chiristians might sometimes lead to downvotes on the internet, and that's about it.  What Christians think about gay people determines whether or not it should be legal for gay folks to have sex (which has only been the case in America for, what, 12 years now?), whether or not they should be denied housing and employment for being gay, what forms of medical care they should have access to, whether they should be allowed to work as teachers or with children, and how likely they are to be beaten to death.  To be quite frank, it's not that we are unwilling to listen, it's that a whole lot of us just plain don't believe that the conservative Christian set actually cares.  If conservative Christians spent half as much time &amp; energy fixing the toxic elements of their own communities as they did complaining about how LGBT people won't listen to them the state of Christian-LGBT discourse would be a lot better for everybody involved.",23

Well, you won't follow my advice so I won't bother telling you that. What I will say is that if you intend to stay with her, you may as well prepare yourself for further hurt and other drama that is surely to come.   She's shown you she doesn't care enough about you to change her situation to decrease the chances of what happened before, from happening again. She's shown you she doesn't care about how you feel. She knows you aren't going to leave her because you're desperate.   This is a bad combination. Don't be surprised if she cheats again, or drags you into some other kind of unnecessary drama.

"hi everybody. first post in this sub, third time trying to write it out, and i'm pretty sure it's smoldering rubble and glass, so bear with me.  &amp;nbsp;  i put a lot of energy into avoiding the bullshit of the worst people. i grew up in the rural u.s. and that is probably the seed of the bullshit i've memorized.  back in that town i learned a more extreme version of what i see everywhere. i learned that for men fashion wasn't supposed to be about self expression or being attractive. as a matter of fact, it wasn't even fashion. we could wear clothes to signal what group we belonged to, and we should dress nice for job interviews. but we had a narrow field to play in. we weren't supposed to express ourselves, or enjoy wearing clothing, or talk about the tactile experience as a sort of garment art. we didn't have outfits, even if we did. going outside of these boundaries landed us in this nonsensical mishmash territory of being less of a man, gay, a fun person to attack, dishonorable, untrustworthy, a threat to society's foundation. it was a fucked up town and it's a fucked up way to think. but it's better to know your enemy, i guess, and i couldn't really avoid seeing the patterns.  there is a lot of pressure to dress normally in the form of some kind of consequence. violence, exclusion, harassment, denied opportunity. and i don't want to care about normal, but a lot of people do, and carry their local definitions like cudgels. so i pander a little, don't wear anything too flashy. i push boundaries a little, wear things that are a little flashy. sometimes i catch some heat for it, people question my masculinity and ... something like strength of character? i try to look a little scary. i'm tall enough and know how to take up space. i don't want this, but i want to feel safe. it isn't just what you wear, it's how you move.  i've definitely been the target of some odd criticism, criticism/envy, envy from guys who very clearly notice how skinny i am. i should either have more muscle or have more fat. around nerdier folks it hasn't been much of an issue, it goes well with any running joke about not being into sports.  fuck, i almost forgot. hair. there's a lot of pressure to have the right kind of hair. (has anyone else noticed the spike in hatred for men with buns? has anyone else noticed how for men it's man-this and man-that? man bun. man cave. man purse. they can't just be things a person does. they are somehow specifically male and goofy and part of a monolithic interpretation of guy shit. man cave has specific man purpose.) i've had long hair, and a lot of lengths between. sorry to any guys who've been stereotyped as being dirty when they had long hair, i contributed to that for a while by not showering much. depression is a hell of a mood disorder. but when i had long hair and it *was* clean and well kept, which did happen too, i would get a lot of comments from people questioning the practicality or appropriateness of such a choice. particularly in the shit town. i wouldn't be able to get a job, they said. there's no reason for me to want it, they said. i compensated for a while with a giant beard. i really just wanted the long hair, but the beard was my ""beard"". no i'm just a dirty hippy, nothing to see here.  i know this isn't how it works for all the guys out there. not everybody carries around this model, some didn't learn it, some didn't internalize it, some weren't exposed to the same kind of disaster-of-ideas, some are braver or more foolhardy or tougher than i am.  fuck, i dunno. i'm two beers deep and the world inside is a mess of anger and apathy and buzz and fatigue. so i'll cut to the story about this guy i knew.  &amp;nbsp;  he was having health problems when we were in our late teens. his blood pressure was dangerously low, among other things. eventually a surgeon cracked open his chest and installed a pacemaker. his family found out after the fact that ~~we~~ **he** had an eating disorder. he and i never had a heart to heart about it. but i don't see how he couldn't have known. and it seems that nobody grilled him on that particular possibility until his sternum had been stapled back together. maybe no one ever did and it came to light another way. which seems a little late to me. hopefully health care pros are generally good at catching that kind of thing these days.  Edit: formatting. double line breaks looked real bad.  Edit 2: in the last paragraph i typoed ""we"" instead of ""he"", it sounded like my friend and i both had eating disorders, but it was in fact just my friend.",15

"Question to both the mods and the community. Is there any interest/viability in the idea of this subreddit curating a list of crappy sellers on tcg? That way when you're buying from a bunch of venders at once, you can come here and compare your cart to the list right before you buy. It would save time/money since you could avoid buying from the dealers who chronically have 'inventory issues.'  Then if this gains some support maybe we can push the idea of a 'blocked seller' list to tcgplayer, from the buyer side. They have a 'block buyer' function on the seller side of things, so I don't know why they don't implement it from the other end. This idea came up over on mtgmarketwatch, and somebody hyperlinked it to the tcgplayer user account, but they didn't respond.   The issue has come up twice in the past week regarding sellers not honoring orders, and numerous other times over the past year or so. Just this past week I reached my tipping point as 5/17 packages (unrelated to the pro tour) were refunded in some way or another.   I don't know if this is something other people would use, or how difficult it would be to curate, but I figured I'd throw it out there and see what everyone else thinks. ",10

"Thanks for the response, it's interesting to think about. I don't actually disagree with a lot of what you say, but we may be talking at cross-purposes a little. I was surprised when friends of mine complained that The Force Awakens was very similar in plot to A New Hope, because that was something I'd enjoyed about it. The idea that the story goes cyclically, and new characters take the place of the old ones. I'm into that. And the introduction of the new cast wasn't something I had a big problem with - the re-establishment of the old stuff was much more of an issue. Maybe I should elaborate on what I meant in my first post. I'll spoiler tag it just in case. And although this is criticism, it doesn't change the fact that I had a really good time during the film and am looking forward to the sequels.  [The Force Awakens spoilers](#s ""The opening crawl is three short paragraphs long and is all about the search for Luke. So it's clear he won't be in the film for a while, but I'm expecting the story to revolve around looking for him. The original trilogy is his story, and the prequel trilogy is background to him - I think it's fair to say that Star Wars is all about Luke, and that opening crawl suggests that the people behind Episode VII understand that too. This is Luke's story. And I know that there are new characters to introduce, and I'm looking forward to that too."")  [Spoilers](#s ""The plot purpose of BB-8 is to join up with R2-D2 and complete the map to Luke's location. Every time the film refuses to link the two of them up, it's playing for time. I was only able to see this in retrospect, but it would have been far more satisfying to get that map completed halfway through the film and get going on the journey to Luke. Because, as I say, the film's opening crawl had promised that that was the focus, and that's why I was left frustrated at the end - they hadn't started to tell the story yet. (I don't mind BB-8, I liked him - but he's not the deal, you know? He's given too much prominence.)"")  [Spoilers](#s ""I enjoyed the comedy in the film - I was surprised that it told so many jokes, and that so many worked - but I was turned off by much of the fan service. The Kessel Run joke sticks out - and there was far too long spent on reintroducing Han, Chewie and the Millennium Falcon. That's what I mean when I talk about the film being preoccupied by the fact that it was Star Wars. I felt that way during the opening titles - ""Wow, it really is back!"" - but it kept drawing attention to itself and never got on with doing its own thing. Of course, I didn't ignore the story that it did tell, and I was interested in Kylo Ren's backstory, but because it wasn't the Luke-focused story the film had promised, it felt like padding when it should have been a very strong plot thread."")  [Spoilers](#s ""Ultimately, the film said it would focus on Luke and it ignored him almost entirely. There was mention of him here and there but it was more or less incidental. Part of me wonders whether Harrison Ford had some influence over this, because he's a grumpy guy and clearly wasn't interested in doing Star Wars for any longer than was necessary, because it seems to me that Han's story should have ended with his death in Episode VIII. That should have been the dark-as-hell ""I am your father"" climax, when all seems lost, setting you up for a triumph in Episode IX. And meanwhile, they'd have got partway through Luke's story in Episode VII, telling it alongside Kylo Ren's/Han's. What should have been two side-by-side plot strands became two separate stories, with the less important one being told first, in its entirety. So that final sequence of shots with Rey approaching Luke was so frustrating because I'd just been told a story that didn't feel very important and was now finally being introduced to the story that was the reason I was there."")  Who knows how different it would have felt if that opening crawl had said something different? Had it talked about the story the film went on to tell, my response might have been completely different, with that final scene being a brilliant escalation of the story rather than an eventual and brief acknowledgement of what I'd been promised in the first place.  Apologies that that was so long, and if I repeated myself, as I no doubt did. But I hope that explains my perspective.",13

"Yeah, as a non-American it always seems like in general my understanding of the American idea of both Cuba and especially Vietnam is kind of paradoxical.  I mean, wasn't the idea that if Cuba and Vietnam were allowed to be ruled by communists that would have dire consequences for America? It seems (to my admittedly not that well-informed opinion... Although I have been to both Vietnam and Cuba) like overall, America's fight against communism has had worse consequences than communism itself. Obviously WAY worse in Vietnam than Cuba.  But in Cuba it's like... For what? Why was there half a century of boxing them out?  Like, to a certain degree it makes some sense why Cuba blames so much on America.  Obviously most of it is not your guys' fault, but not trading with them certainly didn't help the people of Cuba is all I'm saying.   On the other hand, I'll give credit where credit is due: It does seem like America managed to save half of Korea from a terrible fate.  But we don't know that for certain due to the stark contrast between a communist country where the war never ended (North Korea) and a communist country where the war did end (Vietnam). Which seems to indicate that the fact that the war ended was more important than who won... Maybe.  Impossible to say though.  Then again, China and Russia did eventually come around.  But back to the point... Yeah at the end of the day the Vietnam war just seems like an absolutely pointless and tragic loss of life and a fundamental error in judgement.  I can't blame Truman and Eisenhower (and Churchill I suppose, thinking of the Iron Curtain speech here) for their opinion that communism was the be-all end-all of evil and should be fought at all costs, but I sort of wish that opinion was examined a bit by the leaders of America in light of events such as the Vietnam war.    I guess part of it is just a basic human need to justify.  That's a powerful thing and I suppose I can't blame anyone for that.  Like 50 000+ Americans died, that's a hell of a thing to have to tell oneself that it was for nothing.  Actually I can't even imagine having to do that.

Also I wont comment on your finances; you're pretty far off from where you want to be to buy this car, but this advice applies to a more realistic car that you hopefully settle on unless you have your mind made up  &gt;I need insurance just for my girlfriend and I. I think $150/month is OK for my budget.  I live in LA as well, and pay $143 for insurance for just myself. Good luck getting that rate, but if you do, that's fine.  &gt;I don't want to pay top price for a brand new 2016 model. I'm also worried about anything older than 2015. Why? Because of risk. I also know absolutely nothing about 'inspecting' a car, and unlike everyone's advice here, I don't have any magical mechanic friends laying around that I can take with me to inspect any car. I'm extremely on my own, sadly.  You don't need a mechanic friend, you need $100 or so to take to a mechanic who can inspect your car. I recommend Dyrness Automotive, it's where I go. They're right up Brand Avenue of Cars, Colorado and Brand-ish area. Go to them first, ask if they can look at a car you will bring them in an hour or so (they will), and tell the dealership that that's where youre going. Tell them that if you buy the car, they will pay for half of the inspection, otherwise its on you. They will agree.  &gt;Should I buy any add-ons? Gap insurance? Extended warranty? Should I reject all of these things? If so, can I buy them later through a third-party? Who the hell sells that stuff?  Only buy addons if you really want them. Its tough to say no while you are there though, so think about that before hand. As for gap insurance, Geico offers it, get it when you set up your insurance if you want it.  &gt;Should I ever contact a dealership over email first?  Literally wont hurt one bit. Worst case scenario they ignore you and you walk in anyways.  &gt;What does it mean to ""figure out your financing before you go to the dealer""? Let's say I walk into Chase Bank, or some credit union that I magically find on Google. What do I do? What happens? Am I actually getting a loan? Am I just learning about what the loan would cost? Do I fill out paperwork? Am I committing to anything? Am I filling out 99% of some application and then ""waiting"" to sign the dotted line, after I've learned what rate the dealership can offer me? I literally have no idea what this process looks like, and everyone on Reddit casually refers to 'figuring out financing' as though it's some well-known process. I'm totally lost.  IIRC Chase no longer does personal and student loans, but I dont know if that applies to cars. But anyways, just walk in, ask someone in a suit how a car loan works, and follow them. They wont make you sign anything, they wont demand your first born child, they will write a number on a card for you and say, ""we will cover you for $XXXXX at X.X%. Keep that card in your pocket while you buy a car.  &gt;What's a reasonable rate? 2.9%? Should I try negotiating for lower at the dealer?   Depends on your credit. And everything in life is negotiable, ESPECIALLY when buying a car. Don't worry if your salesman doesn't like you; that means you're winning.  &gt;Do I actually need proof of a bank's loan rate to show the dealer? Can't I just make it up and say ""oh, XYZ bank told me they could do it for 2%""? How does this even work?  That card will also have the bank's rep's info on it. They will call the bank and say that you were approved for what it says, they will verify, everyone wins.  &gt;How do I arrange insurance before-hand? If I called Geico, wouldn't they expect me to have the EXACT car (not just the model, but literally the exact one) provided in order to give me insurance? How do I drive a car off the dealership lot?  Buying a car takes a LONG time. While you're sitting there waiting for papers after you have shaken a hand, get the VIN and call Geico. Takes about 15 minutes (not being cheeky, its just a fast process, especially if you are already a customer) but even if for some reason it takes you longer, don't feel bad that the salesman is watching you sit on the phone. You got him/her a sale; it's been a good day. They will say you're good to go, and you are. New cards will be sent out in a few days, but they will give you some confirmation number of sorts. Write it down, and god forbid you get in an accident before the cards come, you will be fine.  Hope this helps, let me know if you have questions on my answers. But stay calm, and be thoughtful. The biggest negotiating tool you have is telling the dealer you are looking at another car down the street, and if you're on Brand, theres about 30 other places you can look so they know you mean it.

"Yes, he was one of the retainers of Oda Nobunaga who was known as ""The Fool of Owari"". He received this moniker because he held no regard to the nuances from the Japanese traditions and Nobility, giving respected positions to those who were truly talented without any thought to their previous social status. Yasuke is an notable example of his behaviour.  Another one was a man who was known as Kosaru (little monkey): Once during a cold night, a sandals-bearer by the name of Kinoshita Tokichiro was waiting for his Lord, Nobunaga, to return from a meeting with his vassals. When the leader of the Oda clan put the sandals his servant gave him, he realised they were warm. At first, he thought Tokichiro was wearing them to avoid getting his own kimono dirty and got angry, but Kinoshita explained he was keeping them inside his kimono to warm them for his Lord, he even showed the marks they left on him. Nobunaga was impressed with the servant's actions and then gave him the opportunity to climb the ranks of his army. A few years later Kinoshita Tokichiro changed his name to Hashiba Hideyoshi and once more later to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, being one of the most important officers under Nobunaga's rule.  After Nobunaga's death at the hands of the traitorous Akechi Mitsuhide, Hideyoshi was the one who kept his dream of unification of Japan alive and was the unofficial successor of the Oda Army. He unified Japan in 1590 after the exhausting Siege of Odawara Castle alongside many of Nobunaga's supporters. Yes, a former sandals-bearer unified Japan and became the Taiko (Imperial Regent) because a man trusted his talent.  Sadly, Hideyoshi died in 1591 and the pig, Tokugawa Ieyasu, another one of Nobunaga's former retainers, decided to announce his plans of unification and end up splitting Japan in two against the supporters of the Toyotomi clan led by Ishida Mitsunari, going as far as waging a huge battle in the lands of Sekigahara in 1600. The war only ended in 1615 after the Siege of Osaka Castle, where Tokugawa was able to execute the heir to the Toyotomi clan, Toyotomi Hideyori, and his mother.

"&gt; you certainly can’t do a spaced coil on one of those fancy coil jogs many of you use  Pfft, sure you can. Just make the coil as usual, then spread the wraps out by inserting a tiny flathead screwdriver between them and twisting gently.  &gt; The resistance of Ni200 is incredibly low, which means many wraps are needed to get to the target resistance for temperature sensing.  It’s so low, in fact, that wrapping a dual coil that actually fits in your RDA is nearly impossible.   Git gud noob. Dual coils, 12 wraps of 26ga Ni200 around a 3mm core in my Mutank right now. 0.06 ohms, and vaping like a champ.  &gt;In short, Ni200 is frustrating to use and might not be very safe, so why use it at all?  Because it's less than $20 for 250 feet, and because the evidence suggests that nickel, when used properly, is perfectly safe. Although I find it pretty convenient that the author of this article, who is paid by Craft Vapery, emphasizes the risks of nickel while downplaying the very same risks in titanium. I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that Craft Vapery sells [titanium wire](https://www.craftvapery.com/products/titanium-wire-10?type_id=5633b5fd639f8a0003000a0c&amp;variant_id=5633b5fd639f8a0003000a0d) for $1.50 a foot.  &gt;I prefer using pure titanium (cue David Guetta’s song by the same name).   I fucking love that song. But because of Sia, not David Guetta.  He later goes on to suggest dry firing titanium coils, and then dry firing them *again* after they're wicked (but still dry). You can go ahead and try that if you want, but I'm definitely not going to be doing either of those two things. Titanium wire is fine if you don't mind paying a little bit extra for it (and usually cleaning it when you get it), but I can't say I like this article. ",6

"You know I think there's a good chance I was the sassy mod who showed up in the game. I didn't arrive because of the mods calls—I arrived because I saw the report queue blow up with multiple reports in one game and I always check it out when that happens.  You were absolutely correct to vote the player in this situation. He was ""AFK"" and that hurt your team in a very real way. In my eyes though, the situation quickly escalated when everyone started chatting about it and making mods calls. The developing confrontation between both players reached a level where the game was falling apart, so rather than issue bans I jumped in and told you both to stop worrying about it and keep playing the game.   The thing about AFK reports is that we are pretty forgiving with them. Who hasn't gotten a text or something and temporarily stopped playing the game? I don't ban for that unless the behavior repeats itself.  And the thing about the false vote you got is that when I show up it's very hard to determine what actually happened in the game. You said it's false but since he voted you for AFK there's no way I can definitely verify if that vote is false or not, even though it most likely was. I didn't see it happen. At this point you're just arguing about something that I can't verify anyway so the only logical thing to do is just move on. It's just not fair to ban for one incident like that so again, I wait for a pattern to develop and then I'll ban once I have the evidence.  I don't like the mods call because it has a tendency to disrupt the game. That's why we only want it to be used in situations where a single player is completely ruining the game for everyone else or being overtly offensive. If you're worried about false votes, the best thing to do is just keep playing the game and come to IRC later to tell us. When you make a mods call it almost always escalates the situation.  **Side note: Update your subreddit flair! Welcome to the sub, we're all nice people. Well, a lot of us are.**",6

"There is a clear pattern of ""new teams"" with good players coming into the scene, beating the top teams a few times to then fall off.

As soon as the top teams get used to the new teams playstyle they start falling off. For a team to prove themselves they need to stay relevant even after the other teams figure them out.  This has happened to:  * Renegades * Cloud9 * Kinguin  and a few other teams to lower extents and some I probably forgot.  We also saw this happen to Astralis back when they were sprouting up. The main difference there was that Astralis actually got over the ""bump"" and stayed a top team.  Currently we are witnessing Luminosity going through the same period. Right now Luminosity is approaching the crucial point in which we will see if they can stay relevant when people figure them out.  I would not really say that Cloud9 got worse.

There are legitimate reasons women (and probably some men) fear marriage - the benefits of marriage are really widely known and discussed, the love letters and everything sound wonderful - but culture/society/tradition can make marriage into more of a burden than a blessing. I don't think it's a bad thing to have a discussion on how to change that, or how to mentally deal with it. Like I said, I personally want to get married and have someone write me nice letters about sunsets and kingfishers, I just want to make sure I don't rush into things and marry a guy who makes my life worse instead of better.

"&gt;With nuclear power there is of course the issue of the waste management, but it is one if the cleanest ways of generating massive amounts of electricity.   The trouble is that the waste issue has become rather pressing. I understand that many nuclear plants already store a great deal of waste on their own premises and transport waste to other sites when capacity is reached. The unfortunate consequence is that there are fewer places to store nuclear waste every year, because all disposal sites are filling to capacity rather quickly.   It's better not to make the waste at all, and look for alternate means of generating power, such as through the sun. ",11

"* By far the largest factor in efficient research is the plane's tier. Basically, so long as the researched plane is the same tier, or one tier above or below as the planes being played with, research is efficient. So a T3 plane can research a T2 or T4 plane efficiently, but T5 and T1 will see significant penalties. (Minor exception: I don't think Premiums have a minimum tier, and can be used to research anything below them)  * Using the plane directly before it in the tree usually gives an ""efficient progress"" modifier of [Edit: +10% RP in RB/SB, +30% RP in AB]. If there's a folder before it, I *think* that it's only the first plane in the folder that counts, but you can check on the stat card.  * Some planes have better rewards than others. I think in most cases it goes up with the BR, but check the percentage mentioned on the stat card. Premiums are almost always better than normal planes in the same tier, and I think they're better than most planes in the tier above them too.  In your specific case, I think the He-112 A-0 should research the Bf-109 slightly faster. However, that low in the tier, the difference is going to be marginal - maybe an extra match's play. The plane you have the most fun with or do best with is the one you should use, really. You don't need to unlock the He-112 B-0 - ""Foldered"" planes are basically a separate branch on the tree and researching them isn't required to advance further ""down"" the tree.",9

"I don't understand... Trump did not treat Megyn Kelly as a man.  Trump treated her to insults, lied about his answer to her question, and then admitted to lying to her in the followup.   Then later went on TV and talked about her period, claiming it was hormones. He tried several times to get Megyn fired, that's not something I would do to a man who asked me a question about what I said in the past.  I never in my life, accused a man of his hormone levels when he asks me a question about something I said in the past.  Trump hates women, there's no question. If you look up the past things he's said to women, you'll find that he almost always focuses on visual aspects of women.   When I debate a man or have an argument, I don't go... ""oh yeah? Well you're fat and ugly!"" But that's what he does with women all the time. But when Trump argues with a man, he doesn't do that. He treats men as equals, and he treats women as inferior.  Melenia Trump is a whore. She's been bought by Trump to live the billionaire life. Melenia is a model.  Similarly, Trump's other divorced ex-wives cleaned him out, for the highest-paid divorces.

You actually aren't supposed to take ESAs or (therapy dogs) in animal restricted areas.  The only thing that ESA status means is that you can rent in properties where you may not usually be able to have an animal and that your animal can fly without fees.,8

"But the real question is how you even completely rearrange a planet's basic chemical compounds to turn it into a mega snowcone? And with Mars, at least Mars kept it's original red rocky surfaces.

"People play Dust2, because, dust 2 is practice friendly, it doesn't expand much on strategy as it favors aim duels. Dust 2 is simple - basic 3 lane layout. People who play casual (I can't speak for everyone) mostly play it to practice, get familiar with the game and its mechanics, and sometimes their friend keeps them company to give some advice. Maps like overpass, nuke etc. are more difficult, because, you must have set of smokes/flashes ( nuke ) to actually be able to do a thing (newke is another story - rush a-b ez tacktick :D)  As for this is what we still want from csgo post.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ontario-video-game-developers-laud-changes-to-media-tax-credit/article24176426/  I helped a company push about 20 million through this program over 2010-2014.  The reality is that these were basically slush funds and the OMDC is one too.  Essentially companies in good standings are able to push through some pretty sloppy paperwork and get cash back on work that is hardly researched.,6

"The OP is uninformed. There are two main school boards, public and Catholic  and in the 25 years I was a principal only one of them normally had a surplus at year end. The other one sometimes asked for a year end 'bailout' to make their budget as they were fairly often in a deficit position. And they had such a rancorous board at one point it ground to a halt and NO administrative work proceeded til the Minister of Education stepped in.  If he wants to save money he'd have to check the history of both boards and then shut down the inefficient one - the *public* school board. (and no I didn't work for the Catholic board)",7

"&gt; Jockeys, swimmers, riders, runners-they all have physical limitations that either help or hinder their performance, so the same should work for formula 1 drivers.  But why? Why should it be the same? In all those examples, there's nothing practical that can be done to level to the playing field. But in car racing, we have the option to level out those differences (within reason). Explain to me why we shouldn't reduce the influence of relatively inconsequential genetic differences in favour of making the sport more skill-dominant?  (By relatively inconsequential, I mean that a few inches of height is not directly relevant to driving. Being 6'1"" instead of 5'9"" does not inherently make you a worse driver, it's the knock-on effects of having to carry more weight to be healthy at that height. As opposed to something like basketball, where being taller is a clear advantage for the most part.)",6

"#Notable Rolls: ""Back At It"" Edition  **Titan - Ruin Wings - Intellect/Discipline**  Roll: Split-stat; PvE Tier: **A**  It's been a little over a month since we last saw the Ruin Wings available. Nothing much as changed insofar as their potency in PvE is concerned. They still give you lots of purple bricks with lots of heavy ammo, and that's just about all they're good for. They possess excellent synergy with ammo-efficient Heavies like the Sleeper Simulant, which now appreciates receiving near-full ammunition with every drop; or Bolt Caster, which chews through ammo as quickly as it does trash mobs in PvE. They work on any Titan class, and are thus an excellent choice when your needs for a challenge may require flexibility. In PvP, there is zero point to wearing these; the slight ""bonus"" to maximum Heavy Ammo that is effected by Seeds of Ruin can be replicated with the right auxiliary armor. Newbie Titans would do well to pick these up.  Try to get Sniper Reloader, and Paramuscular Armature if you re-roll.  ***  **Hunter - Mask of the Third Man - Intellect/Discipline**  Roll: Split-stat; PvE Tier: **B**  I debated giving this a **C** simply because it is exclusively beneficial to a class I've not seen in PvE since the Dark ^Below Ages, but thought I would cut it some slack as one of the better options of a bad situation. Yes, Bladedancer has no real practical purpose in end-game PvE, but the Mask of the Third Man is a decent Exotic in spite of this. It grants a small amount of extra time to the Arc Blade super, and rapid slashes consume less Super Energy than without it on. Unfortunately, its usefulness stops here, and the sad reality that it takes the entire duration of a Super to carve up even a mid-level enemy means having a few extra cuts just doesn't cut it. It's the lowest of **B** tiers for this reason. In PvP, if your hit detection is feeling generous, there's a much more compelling case for its usefulness to Bladedancers to eke out that last-second kill.  Aim for Crucible-friendly perks if you re-roll this, like Ashes to Asset.   ***  **Warlock - Light Beyond Nemesis - Intellect/Strength**  Roll: High/low; PvE Tier: **A**  There have been a few opportunities to snag this excellent Exotic, but an extra one never hurts. I would dearly love to give it an **S** in PvE, but I'll settle for a very high **A**. It is bar-none the safest and most team-forward Exotic in end-game PvE content. You'll spawn an extra orb with your first kill in your Super state, and the overall cap for Nova Bomb, and the roaming Radiance/Stormtrance hops up by one too. This translates to more Supers all around; in fact, two offensive Guardians running Keeper of the Pack Exotics will make a noticeable difference in your team's Super output. Of course, this means it's useless in solo content, hence why I can't in good faith give it the universal S. Exotic helms are also prized in PvE for the ease with which one can score the most essential PvE perk there is: Inverse Shadow. Just a few glass needles should be all it takes to get a desirable roll. In PvP, it is a top-tier Exotic for Trials of Osiris, Skirmish, and Salvage, benefiting its wearer with lightning-fast revives that many would argue are downright essential for momentum play.  If you're twisting this for PvE, Inverse Shadow and Infusion are great perks. In PvP, Quintessence Transfer still procs on Guardians, so you can't go wrong there.  ***",176
